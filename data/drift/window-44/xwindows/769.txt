I have gotten X11R5 pl 23 to compile on AIX 3.2.2 using cc.
but the server will not run. it simplys starts and a couple seconds
later exits. no error are displayed.
my defines for compile are
DSYSV DAIXV3 DSYSV WAIT DMALLOC 0 RETURNS NULL
could somewhere share some light, or maybe the ibm.cf file.
thanks.
