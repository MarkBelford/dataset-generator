The title line says it. The Galaxy package was just recently announced, and
includes a GUI builder and portable toolkit. I'm interested in any
feedback from those who may have used it thus far.
We've been using it for a year on Unix Sun and HP and Windows platforms. In my
opinion, it is the best toolkit on the market. It supports a rich API to a high
level IPC mechanism, file system abstraction, memory management, command driven
application development, drawing, geometry management, and, oh yeah, Open Look,
Motif, MS Windows and Mac at the flip of a switch .
Thanks
