Hello world,
I want to write my Xt application code like this:
do some work
now I need some user input
XmCreateDialog
wait for user input input
if input OK
more work
else
other work
So more work and other work are not in callback functions but the
application simply waits for the user to answer the question.
How can I code this in my Xt Motif application
Thanks very much in advance.
Greetings, Huub.
