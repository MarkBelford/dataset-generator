From article , by Dan Eldred :
I know this is a long shot, but does anyone know what solvent I should
use to clean duct tape adhesive from carpet
Someone taped wires to the carpet, and now it is time to move out.
I don't know for sure that this will work, but you might try MEK methyl
ethyl keytone . It worked getting the stickum left over from shelf paper,
and is available at paint stores. Use a carbon gas mask and lots of
ventilation this stuff really stinks

For those who don't know, methyl ethyl ketone is more commonly known
as ACETONE and can be found as the major active ingredient in
NAIL POLISH REMOVER. YOUR WIFE'S PROBABLY GOT SOME HANGIN' AROUND.
