chances this year , but it seems to me like Washington is the ONLY
team that can stop the Penguins from winning their next Stanley Cup.
Really I think both the Islanders and Devils would have a better chance
at the Penguins than the Capitals, IMO.

Contact for the '93 '94 '91 STANLEY CUP will have greater rewards.

11 STRAIGHT WINS better than nothing at all
Really What makes you think the Islanders have a better shot They
couldn't even beat the Whalers in two games
Well, since you're a Pens fans the whole question is moot. I think
the teams most likely to beat the Pens are the Bruins, Nordiques, and
Blackhawks but I don't think they can really do it. :
