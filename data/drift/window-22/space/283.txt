If anyone knows anyone else who would like to get sci.space,
but doesn't have an Internet feed or has a cryptic Internet
feed , I would be willing to feed it to them.
Kudos to Mark for his generous offer, but there already exists a
large email based forwarding system for sci.space posts: Space Digest.
It mirrors sci.space exactly, and provides simple two way communication.
I think Mark was talking about making it available to people who didn't
have email in the first place.
If anybody in the Boston area wants a sci.space feed by honest to gosh UUCP
no weird offline malreaders , let me know. I'll also hand out logins to
anyone who wants one, especially the Boston Chapter of NSS which I keep forgetting
to re attend .
