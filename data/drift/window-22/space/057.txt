Has anyone ever heard of a food product called Space Food Sticks
I remember those awful things. They were dry and crumbly, and I
recall asking my third grade teacher, Miss G'Francisco, how they
kept the crumbs from floating around in zero G. She had no clue.
I have not seen anything like them in today's space program.
Some Apollo technology is best forgotten.
