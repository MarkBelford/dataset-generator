Does anyone have any info on the apparent sightings of Vulcan
All that I know is that there were apparently two sightings at
drastically different times of a small planet that was inside Mercury's
orbit. Beyond that, I have no other info.
Does anyone know anything more specific
As I heard the story, before Albert came up the the theory
o'relativity and warped space, nobody could account for
Mercury's orbit. It ran a little fast I think for simple
Newtonian physics. With the success in finding Neptune to
explain the odd movments of Uranus, it was postulated that there
might be another inner planet to explain Mercury's orbit.
It's unlikely anything bigger than an asteroid is closer to the
sun than Mercury. I'm sure we would have spotted it by now.
Perhaps some professionals can confirm that.
