It appears to use two balanced line connections, but what each connection
corresponds to I know not. One connection is a 30 way IDC, the other a
60 way IDC.
Sounds like it is an SMD interface to me, not being at work now
to actually count pins. there are two varients, SMD and
SMDC I think , only minor differences between them. Widely used
prior to the advent of SCSI for large drives or all drives on minis
and mainframes no experience on those .
