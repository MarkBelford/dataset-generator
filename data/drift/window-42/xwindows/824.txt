I am looking of information regarding UIMX. I believe this is an application
front end generator tool for Motif among others . Whould someone given me a
contact I need to get hold of the programmers' guide, or something like it.

I went to the XWorld convention in NY and talked to the people
from Bluestone who make UIMX. They sent me a HUGE 3 ring binder
of info and a demo tape. Let me know what you need.
