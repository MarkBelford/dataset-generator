1 Don't use big capacitors. They are unreliable for timing due to
leakage.
Instead, use a quartz crystal and divide its frequency by 2 40 times
or something like that.
1 MHz divided by 2 40 1 cycle per 2 weeks, approximately.
2 I wouldn't expect any components other than batteries or electrolytic
capacitors to fail at 40 C or 40 F for that matter either : .
The battery is going to be your big problem. Also, of course, your
circuit shouldn't depend on exact values of resistors which a crystal
controlled timer won't .
Wouldn't a crystal be affected by cold My gut feeling is that, as a
mechanically resonating device, extreme cold is likely to affect the
compliance terminology of the quartz, and hence its resonant frequency.
