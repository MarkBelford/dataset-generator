Hi,
I have a piece of X code that compiles fine on pmax ul4, pmax mach, as
well as sun4 mach, but whenever it compiles on sun4 411, it gives me
undefined ld errors:
sin
cos
pow
floor
get wmShellWidgetClass
get applicationShellWidgetClass
The following libraries that I linked it to are:
lXaw lXmu lXt lXext lX11
The makefile is generated off an imake template.
Can anyone give me pointers as to what I'm missing out to compile on
a sun4 411
Thanx
Wilson
