I would appreciate any thoughts on what makes a planet habitable for Humans.
I am making asumptions that life and a similar atmosphere evolve given a range
of physical aspects of the planet. The question is what physical aspects
simply disallow earth like conditions.
Dandridge Cole and Isaac Asimov collaborated on a book titled,
Habitable Planets for Man I think in 1964. It should be available
in most good libraries, or through inter library loan.
Some more references:

Habitable Planets for Man
Blaisdell Publishing Company, New York 1964
I don't know if this can be found any more.

An Estimate of the Prevalence of Biocompatible and Habitable Planets
J. Brit. Interplanetary. Soc., 45 , 3 12, 1992
The first paper includes a detailed discussion of the physical conditions
for habitability.
