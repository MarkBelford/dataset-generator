I guess what I am saying is that your question is difficult, if not
impossible, to answer. What exactly do you want to know Do you need a good
one for a project you are working on How secure must it be Are you trying
to crack one that someone else has used I can probably make suggestions,
assuming the activity is strictly legal. In general, it is a BAD idea,
legally, to tamper with copy protection. It can also lead to corruption of
files which you necessarily do not have back ups of being as they are copy
protected, which can be devestating. Do you have absolutely no ideas for
practical applications, and are merely curious
Please clear up those questions, and I'll try to help as much as I
can.
May we interpret this as an offer to volunteer as editor for a
Copy protection FAQ I am quite sure that I am not alone welcoming such
an initiative I will volunteer to ask some of the questions, if you will
provide the answers :

Hey, now will you stop encouraging him Copy protection only serves one pur
pose: to keep the honest buyer from making legal backup copies. It will
definitely not stop any pirates. If you want to protect you soft, supply a
good documentation and support. This is IMHO the only way of effectively pro
tecting software.
