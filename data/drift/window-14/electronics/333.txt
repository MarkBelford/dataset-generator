Hi Netters
I am looking for the list of universities in Austrailia, which has electronics department.
I am considering to spend a year for research in Austrailia about communication area. I am interested in Mobile communication areas and spread spectrum communications etc.
But I don't have any information about Austrailian Universities.
Can anybody recommend a good university in communication area
Any comments will be welcomed
Bye.
