So what's the story here. we're all stuck with the regular
green, red, and off yellow orange LED's What gives
Anybody have a 'scoop' on FAIRLY LOW PRICED BLUE LED's
In order to emit blue light, a semiconductor must have a band gap energy
within the region of 2.6 to 2.8 electron Volts. According to my physical
electronics prof, you can't get an LED with that band gap. That's why you
He's mistaken. They exist, the semiconductor is silicon carbide, and they
are inefficient and expensive. The bandgap is around 2.7 ev.
don't find blue LEDs or, for that matter, some other colour of LEDs. That
is not to say that blue LEDs can't be found. I've seen 'blue' LEDs sold,
but they were just your typical visible light LED in a blue plastic covering.
They didn't emit very much light.
The ones I have are clear plastic. Pray tell, what would make a typical
LED emit blue light
