One could go on and on and on here, but I wonder . how
many people read sci.space and of what power influence are
these individuals
Quick Everyone who sees this, post a reply that says:
Hey, I read sci.space
Then we can count them, and find out how many there are :
This will also help answer that nagging question: Just what is
the maximum bandwidth of the Internet, anyways
As an Amateur Radio operator VHF 2metres I like to keep up with what is
going up and for that matter what is coming down too .
In about 30 days I have learned ALOT about satellites current, future and
past all the way back to Vanguard series and up to Astro D observatory
space . I borrowed a book from the library called Weater Satellites I
think, it has a photo of the earth with a TIROS type satellite on it.
I would like to build a model or have a large color poster of one of the
TIROS satellites I think there are places in the USA that sell them.
ITOS is my favorite looking satellite, followed by AmSat OSCAR 13
AO 13 .
