In article ,
AW ST had a brief blurb on a Manned Lunar Exploration
confernce May 7th at Crystal City Virginia, under the
auspices of AIAA.
Thanks for typing that in, Steven.
I hope you decide to go, Pat. The Net can use some eyes
and ears there.
I plan to go. It's about 30 minutes away from my home.
I can report on some of it from my perspective .
Anyone else on sci.space going to be there If so, send me
netmail. Maybe we can plan to cross paths briefly.
I'll maintain a list of who's going.
