If re boosting the HST by carrying it with a shuttle would not damage it,
then why couldn't HST be brought back to earth and the repair job done
here
I'm not sure if this is a big issue, but it seems to me like it
might be up till now, all 1g forces applied to the mirror and
its mounting and nearly all 1g forces have been applied along the
telescope's optical axis, and against the mirror's base. Reentry
would apply forces along roughly the same axis, but tending to pull
the mirror away from the mount, and the landing would apply on edge
forces to both the mirror and mount. It could be that one or both
of these would not survive.
