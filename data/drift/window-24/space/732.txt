Demonstrating that these puppies are beyond the oort cloud would
require resolution on the order of arcseconds, since the oort
cloud is postulated to extend to about 0.5 parsec all together
now: Parallax ARc SECond , a parsec is the distance of an object
that demonstrates one arc second of parallax with a 2 AU base line .
According to my Glossary of Astronomy and Astrophysics :
parsec abbreviation for parallax second The distance at which
one astronomical unit subtends an angle of 1 second of arc. 1 pc
206,265 AU 3.086 X 10 13 km 3.26 lt yr.
