Hello. I am looking for a program or algorithm that can be used
to compute sunrise and sunset times.
Would you mind posting the responses you get
I am also interested, and there may be others.
Thanks,
N. Shirlene Pearson
There is an excellent software program called Astro.calc that does that and
much more. The latest address I have is
