I was wondering if people had any good uses for old
256k SIMMs. I have a bunch of them for the Apple Mac
and I know lots of other people do to. I have tried to
sell them but have gotten NO interest.
Well, if you're willing to spend a little money, you could buy one
of those IDE caching controllers assuming you have an IDE of course
and put the 256K SIMMs on them. Hardware cache
