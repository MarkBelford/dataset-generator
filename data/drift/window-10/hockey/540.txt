Tonight in Boston, the Buffalo Sabres blanked the Boston
Bruins 4 0 tonight in Boston. Looks like Boston can hang
this season up, because Buffalo's home record is awesome
This is great. Buffalo fans might get to see revenge for
last year :
I'm glad Grant Fuhr will never be as over confident after two wins
as you are.it takes four wins to defeat an opponent.each tougher
to obtain than the previous one. Buffalo is off to a good start.
Fuhr is proving the Fuhr bashers wrong, but Boston is an awfully
good team.

Awesome home record or not, you need to remember the 7th game last year at the
Aud. I'd like to see some playoff games since I'm stuck in Buffalo at UB, but
I think Boston isn't giving up so easy.
