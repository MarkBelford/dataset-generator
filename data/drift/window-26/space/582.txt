Come to think of it, they might send someone on
a quest to get rid of the dang thing.
Actually, the idea, like most good ideas, comes from Jules Verne, not
The Gods Must Be Crazy. In one of his lesser known books I can't

one of them drops a fob watch. They then speculate about the reaction
of the natives to finding such a thing, dropped straight down from heaven.
