Hmmm. I seem to recall that the attraction of solid state record
players and radios in the 1960s wasn't better performance but lower
per unit cost than vacuum tube systems.
I don't think so at first, but solid state offered better reliabity,
id bet, and any lower costs would be only after the processes really scaled up.
Careful. Making statements about how solid state is generally more
reliable than analog will get you a nasty follow up from Tommy Mac or
Pat. Wait a minute you are Pat. Pleased to see that you're not
suffering from the bugaboos of a small mind.
