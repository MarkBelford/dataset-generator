Comet Gehrels 3, which was discovered in 1977, was determined to have
been in a temporary Jovian orbit from 1970 to 1973. Comet Shoemaker Levy 1993e
may remain in orbit around Jupiter long enough to allow Galileo to
make some closeup observations. The orbital trajectory for Comet
Shoemaker Levy is still being determined.
What about positional uncertainties in S L 1993e
If Comet Shoemaker Levy 1993e is in Jovian orbit, and if the comet
is still hanging around when Galileo arrives, then I'm sure it will
be added to the list of targets. We'll have by then over two years
of Earth based observations to help narrow down the positions of the
pieces of the comet. It probably won't be too much different than
what was done with Gaspra.

Galileo did not image Toutatis. That came from Earth based radar.
