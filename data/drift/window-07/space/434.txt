Hmmm. I seem to recall that the attraction of solid state record
players and radios in the 1960s wasn't better performance but lower
per unit cost than vacuum tube systems.
I don't think so at first, but solid state offered better reliabity,
id bet, and any lower costs would be only after the processes really scaled up.
