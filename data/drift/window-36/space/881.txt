What evidence indicates that Gamma Ray bursters are very far away
Given the enormous power, i was just wondering, what if they are
quantum black holes or something like that fairly close by
Why would they have to be at galactic ranges
David gives good explaination of the deductions from the isotropic,
edged' distribution, to whit, they are either part of the Universe or
part of the Oort cloud.
I don't know what you mean by 'edged', but surely there are two other
possibilities for an isotropic distribution: near interstellar up to
100 pc, i.e. within the disc , or the Galaxy's corona
Why couldn't they be Earth centred, with the edge occuring at the edge
of the gravisphere I know there isn't any mechanism for them, but there
isn't a mechanism for the others either.

Among the gods, there is a dispute as to which one of them originally
thought of Christianity or, as they call it, the Great Leg Pull. Apollo
has the best claim, but a sizeable minority support Pluto, ex God of the
Dead, on the grounds that he has a really sick sense of humour. Tom Holt
