I know this is a long shot, but does anyone know what solvent I should
use to clean duct tape adhesive from carpet
I use WD 40.
May I tease out a sub thread from this discussion
Can you all please tell me how to remove the stickers from new houses'
appliances and outdoor lampposts Especially the lamppost, right on
the glass. Isn't there something you can rub into stuck on labels that
will release them from their death grip on glass or other hard surfaces
Many thanks for any help.
Try WD 40.
