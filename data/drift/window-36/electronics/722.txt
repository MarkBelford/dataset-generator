Do you know any assembly language at all All anyone needs to do if
find the part of the code that does the quiz, and insert a JMP instruction
to just completely skip it. Not that difficult, really And there is very
little that commpanies can do to stop this type of thing. Using PKLITE or
some similar utility would help, but only if the resulting compressed .EXE
were tagged as uncompressable.
And even that doesn't help, there are at least two programs available
that fixes this UNP and DISLITE, both available from Simtel 20 . And
even without them it isn't THAT hard to fix.
