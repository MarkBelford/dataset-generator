Hi there,
Can anyone tell me where it is possible to purchase controls found
on most arcade style games. Many projects I am working on would
be greatly augmented if I could implement them. Thanx in advance.
HAP controls just outside Chicago sells these. I don't remember which
suburb they are in. The prices are pretty reasonable and they are
easy to hook up. I bought a new coin mechanism from them for $25.00
a couple of years ago.
