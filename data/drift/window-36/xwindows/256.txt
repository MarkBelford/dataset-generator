As per your question: why not have the button handler add the object, and
then call the window redraw or whatever directly Although, depending
This design will work but I don't think it can take easily take advantage
of expose event redraw optimization that is, the whole window will be
redrawn, not just the area with the new item.
P.S. I'm replying here because my your mailer didn't agree with the
return address
