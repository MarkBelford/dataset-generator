If you paid $19.95 for a CD, you're a fool and you got ripped off.
Please tell me where I can get a CD on the Wergo Music label for less
than $20.
foolishly,
John Davison
What's so special about this label, that their discs are going for
upwards of $6 more than most retail outlets average prices for CDs
