I think you tried to send me a message re: the animation query
I posted to comp.windows.x. I've appended what I received below.
If you can remember what you typed, I'd appreciate another attempt

Hi, I'm new to this group so please bear with me
Two years ago I wrote a Sunview application for fast animation
of raster files. With Sunview becoming rapidly obselete, I've
finally decided to rewrite everything from scratch in XView.
I put together a quick test, and I've found that XPutImage
is considerably slower factor of 2 on average than the
Sunview command pw rop which moves image data from memory
pixrects to a canvas. This was on a Sparc IPX. It seems that:
1 the X protocol communication is slowing things down or
2 XPutImage is inefficient.or both My question is, what
is the fastest way in X11R5 to dump 8 plane image data to
a window Can I take advantage of the fact that the client is
running on the same machine as the server Or am I stuck with
XPutImage in which case I might as well give up now.
All help appreciated.thanks
