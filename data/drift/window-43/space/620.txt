I was suggesting that the minority of professional and amateur astronomers
have the right to a dark, uncluttered night sky.
Sorry, you have a wish for an uncluttered night sky, but it
isn't a right. When you get down to it, you actually have no rights
that the majority haven't agreed to give you and them in the process .
It's a common misconception that being born somehow endows you with
rights to this that and the other. Sadly this is not true.
Now if you want to talk about the responsibility that should go with
the power to clutter the night sky, then that's a different matter.
