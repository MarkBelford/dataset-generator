The following problem is really bugging me,
and I would appreciate any help.
I create two windows:
w1 child to root with event mask ButtonPressMask KeyPressMask
w2 child to w1 with do not propagate mask ButtonPressMask KeyPressMask
Keypress events in w2 are discarded, but ButtonPress events fall through
to w1, with subwindow set to w2.
FYI, I'm using xnews olvwm.
Am I doing something fundamentally wrong here
