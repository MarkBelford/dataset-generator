What I usually use.and this stuff is only good on glass.is either Acetone,
or a little Benzene. The latter of the two is a bit dangerous possibly a
carcinogen sp but it usualy gets the job done. I imagine you can you the two
solvents on most metals as well as glass, but keep the stuff away from plastic.
Benzene is most definitely a carcinogen. If you can get your hands on it
Don't use it
