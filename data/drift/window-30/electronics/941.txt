From article , by Alan Erickson :
I'm trying to bring in 8 bits to a PC, and would like
to use interrupt driven routines. Without buying an IO
board or making a new port, where can I bring in these
bits LPT seems to have only a few inputs, but I've heard
rumours that some LPTs have bidirectional lines. Anybody
know fer sure If any bi d LPTs, which boards have them
I'll be running a new 386DX 33
