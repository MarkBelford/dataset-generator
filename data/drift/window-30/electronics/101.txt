The Ohmite company was the first to characterize resistances by numbers, thus
our use of the Ohms.
Yeah, right. And the company was started by George Simon Ohmite.
That's completely inaccurate. The ohm was an original standard made equal
to a the resistance of a standardized electric stove heating element. That's
where the song Ohm on the Range came from, of course.
