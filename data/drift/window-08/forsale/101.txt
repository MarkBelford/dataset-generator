I have for sale Quicken 3.0 PC Version that allows you to balance
i assume you get new releases earlier than we do here last i saw, version
2.0 was the latest.
He is probably referring to the DOS version. the dos versions is up
to like version 6 i think. The window version just came out recently
so it is only up to like version 2 or something.
