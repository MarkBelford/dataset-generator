If the new Kuiper belt object is called 'Karla', the next
one should be called 'Smiley'.
Unless I'm imaging things, always a possibility 1992 QB1, the Kuiper Belt
object discovered last year, is known as Smiley.
As it happens the second one is Karla. The first one was
Smiley. All subject to the vagaries of the IAU of course,
but I think they might let this one slide.
Gee, I feel so ignorant now.
Research, then post.
