try finding a friend that has caller id, then give him a call.
Greetings
Situation: I have a phone jack mounted on a wall. I don't
know the number of the line. And I don't want
to call up the operator to place a trace on it.
Question: Is there a certain device out there that I can
use to find out the number to the line
Thanks for any response.
