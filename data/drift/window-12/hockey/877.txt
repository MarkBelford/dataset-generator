Again I assume this is not just flame bait by Roger, but actually a
truly held opinion.
I would say that the letter clearly implies representation of the views of
a group that I belong to. And I don't share those views. And I don't
believe that the majority of posters on r.s.hockey share those views.
And so I have no intention of allowing them to simply go ahead without
making my feelings on the subject clear.
Thanks. For speaking for all those who didn't feel it was important
enough to say something themselves.
I wouldn't say that the letter clearly implies representation of the
views of a group that you belong to. It represents a subset that you
don't belong to of a larger group which you do, if only because this
isn't a moderated group .
Look, there are several ways to state an opposing viewpoint. Three
that come to mind are as follows:
1 Say it subtly. Result: it may not be clear.
2 Say it directly yet politely. Result: probably it will spark some
interesting conversation.
3 Say it directly and obnoxiously. Result: validity goes right out
the window.
I would agree that unwarranted use of said term is entirely immature.
You realize that anything you say can, and most certainly will, be
used against you.
