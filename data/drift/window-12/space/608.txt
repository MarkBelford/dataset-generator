I know it's only wishful thinking, with our current President,
but this is from last fall:
Is there life on Mars Maybe not now. But there will be.

Lets hear it for Dan Goldin.now if he can only convince the rest of
our federal government that the space program is a worth while
investment
I hope that I will live to see the day we walk on Mars, but
we need to address the technical hurdles first If there's sufficient
interest, maybe we should consider starting a sci.space group
devoted to the technical analysis of long duration human spaceflight.
Most of you regulars know that I'm interested in starting this analysis
as soon as possible.
