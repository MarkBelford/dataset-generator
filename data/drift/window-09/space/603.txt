What evidence indicates that Gamma Ray bursters are very far away
Their distribution is very isotropic and the intensity distribution,
crudely speaking, indicates we're seeing an edge to the distribution.
How can you tell the difference between an intensity distribution which
is due to an edge in the spatial distribution and an intensity
distribution which is due an a sharp dropoff of intrinsic luminosities
below a certain threshold Could you describe roughly what the
intensity distribution is like
