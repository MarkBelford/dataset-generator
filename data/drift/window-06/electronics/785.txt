Would it be better to use a circuit based on the volume of the beeps
on the cassette, or better for the leds to respond to a tone of a certain
frequency Is there any easy way to do either of these I'm looking for
the simplest circuit possible. I guess what I'm asking for is some sort of
color organ, but not quite. Let me trt to explain again.
Look for information about 567 tone decoder chip. It is an easy to use
chip for detecting sound of certain frequency. You need only one
567 and some other componets for each led you want to control.
The chip can take the voltage levels, which the casette gives.
Radio Shack Archer Semiconductor Reference Guide gives good information
how to use that chip. It should be simplest way to go. The chip costs
something like 1 2 $.
LOWERY'S LAW:
If it jams force it. If it breaks,
it needed replacing anyway.
