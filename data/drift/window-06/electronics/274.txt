If you are going to use one where it counts eg:aviation, space scuttle,
etc then I suggest you go and buy a Fluke never seen a Beckman , however
for every other use you can buy a cheapie.
My Beckman died a few days ago, thanks do about a 4 or 5 foot drop onto a
lab table. $ $ $ Probably not indicative of anything, but I've
already filled out the requisition for a Fluke 87. :
Oh yeah, and sometimes our measurements here do count. Not often, but often
enough that I want at least one good meter
