It has been known for quite a while that the earth is actually more pear
shaped than globular spherical. Does anyone make a globe that is accurate
as to actual shape, landmass configuration Long Lat lines etc.
I don't think you're going to be able to see the differences from a sphere
unless they are greatly exaggerated. Even the equatorial bulge is only
about 1 part in 300 you'd never notice a 1mm error in a 30cm globe
and the other deviations from spherical shape are much smaller.

I remember a physic prof. who talked about scaling a cue ball to Earth size.
Its was significantly less spherical that the Earth
