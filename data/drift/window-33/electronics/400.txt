Well, this is my second try at posting on this subject. Here goes.
In Texas Corpus Christi at least if you pick up the phone and
dial
890 the phone company will read the number of the phone you are on
back to you. I believe the service department uses this to make
certain they are repairing the correct lines when they open the BIG
junction boxes. I don't know if it will work but you can give it a
try. Good luck.
Where I live, I use BCTEL. The number to dial is 211 for the same result.
