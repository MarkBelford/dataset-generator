Hi, I'm looking for a circuit, that is called a Jacob's Ladder .
This little box is usually seen in sci fi movies. It consists of
two curves of wire protruding into the air, with little blue sparks
starting at their base where the two wires are closer to each other ,
moving up the wires to the top, and ending in a small crackling noise.
Could anyone supply me with the schematic for the innards of this box
Thanks in advance
Mike
