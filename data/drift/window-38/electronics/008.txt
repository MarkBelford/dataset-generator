In article you write:
Whats required to get onto the ACCESS bus The nice thing about the
i2c is that most i o requires one 8 . 16 pin DIL chip, ie its cheap
and easy. Anyone can design a bus, trouble is most buses require a
host of interface chips and often on board intelligence.
Bruce,
For the latest information on Access.Bus call the Access.Bus
Industry Group at 408 991 3517. Also, Sun will be hosting the next
meeting of the group on April 19th, here in Mountain View. For some reason
I am not able to post to any newsgroups today, so please feel free to pass
this information on yourself as you see fit.
