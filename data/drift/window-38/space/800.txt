Why not build a inflatable space dock.
If you're doing large scale satellite servicing, being able to do it in
a pressurized hangar makes considerable sense. The question is whether
anyone is going to be doing large scale satellite servicing in the near
future, to the point of justifying development of such a thing.
inflate the dock with a gas is does not have to be oxygen, just neeeds to
be non flameble, non damaging to the satellite and abel to maintain heat .
You'd almost certainly use air. Given that you have to pressurize with
something , safety considerations strongly suggest making it breathable
even if the servicing crew is using oxygen masks for normal breathing,
to avoid needing a ventilation system, it's nice if the hangar atmosphere
is breathable in a pinch it makes mask functioning much less critical .
