ANNOUNCEMENT: The HyperKnowledge PROJECT for NeXTSTEP
I know this is kinda off the subject of sci.space, but not really, I want to
answer this for their, as well as everyone else's information. What these
people are proposing, by and large already exists and can be purchased today.
It is called labview by National Instruments. IT is a wonderful object
IT is a wonderful object oriented graphical programming language.

I am afraid you are mis directed. NeXTSTEP is an operating system as opposed to
a package. I have read a little about it but since Steve Jobs does not seem to
have the marketing capabilities of Bill Gates my info. is limited. Probably why
the far inferior Windows NT is going to be more widely distributed but that
is another flame ridden story . Some of the innovative features of NeXTSTEP are
binary compatibility across platforms eg you can just copy your program from
a Sparc to a PC and it would run, as opposed to buying the version of the package
ported to a PC , graphical object oriented design its all WSIWIG postscript ,
supports parallel hetrogeneous processing, and best of all it is based around
the Mach micro kernel so you can make it look like Unix with X, or DOS, or NT or
even VMS if you feel the need. No package out there comes even close. I hope
people will subscribe to the HyperKnowledge project and NeXTSTEP finally
takes off in my lifetime :
