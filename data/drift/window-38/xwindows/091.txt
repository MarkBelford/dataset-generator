it doesnt matter what window mgr you running under, you can use the X
routine:
XIconfiyWindow display, w, screen number
Display display
Window w
int screen number
as in
XiconifyWindow XtDisplay w , XtWindow w , 0
does that perform what you want

an application running under a Motif window manager. I have tried
several approaches includeing sending events to the application's
border window, but to no avail Anyone done this before
