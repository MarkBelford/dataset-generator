Greetings.
I am developing an application that allows a user to interactively
create edit view a visual model i.e. topology of their network, and
I was wondering if anyone knew of any builder tools that exist to
simplify this task.
In the past I have used Visual Edge's UIM X product to develop other
GUIs, so I am familiar with UIMSs in general.
The topology will support objects and connecting links. Once the
topology is created, I want to provide the user with capabilities to
support grouping, zooming, etc.
I am looking for some form of a higher abstraction other than X drawing
routines to accomplish this. Specifically, the zooming and grouping
aspects may prove difficult, and certainly time consuming, if I have
to roll my own .

You don't mention your platform but Digital has a custom widget, NetEd,
which does exactly what you want to do. Cost is nominal 300 or so call your
local office. The widget is supported on a variety of platforms and I heard
rumblings of porting to Sun, etc. so it may be worth the check.
