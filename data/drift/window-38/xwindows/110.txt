I posted about this a while ago but without code excerpts noone was
able to help me.
The problem is that main win.win is doing fine, but when I create
detail win.win, it does not receive it's initial expose events until
main win.win receives an event. Here are the relevent calls:
main win.win XCreateSimpleWindow mydisplay, DefaultRootWindow mydisplay ,
myhint.x, myhint.y, myhint.width, myhint.height,
main win.line thick, fg, bg
XSetStandardProperties mydisplay, main win.win, main win.text,
main win.text, None, argv, argc, myhint
main win.gc XCreateGC mydisplay, main win.win, 0, 0
XMapRaised mydisplay, detail win.win
XMapSubwindows mydisplay, main win.win
The event mask for main win is:
PPosition PSize StructureNotifyMask ExposureMask KeyPressMask
EnterWindowMask LeaveWindowMask
The flags are
PPosition PSize
I then create detail win.win with the following calls hints has new values :
detail win.win XCreateSimpleWindow mydisplay, DefaultRootWindow mydisplay ,
myhint.x, myhint.y, myhint.width, myhint.height,
detail win.line thick, fg, bg
XSetStandardProperties mydisplay, main win.win, detail win.text,
detail win.text, None, argv, argc, myhint
detail win.gc XCreateGC mydisplay, detail win.win, 0, 0
XMapRaised mydisplay, detail win.win
Event Mask and flags are identical to main win's flags and event mask.
If anybody has any idea why the initial expose events of detail win.win
are not received until main win.win receives an event I'd love to hear
from them. Other that that everything works great so there must be some
detail I'm overseeing.
Thanks for any tips
