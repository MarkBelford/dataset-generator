In article you write:
VA, CT, Wash DC and I think BC Canada where I've heard they actually
use Radar detector detectors.
Nope, not in British Columbia. Detectors are legal here in BC, I've even
got one.
In Alberta and Ontario they're illegal, and detection devices are sometimes
used. I've heard the police in Ontario prefer a much more direct method of
detection. Just trigger the radar gun, watch for people slamming on the
brakes, and search the car.

Detectors are legal in Alberta, the old law was overturned a long time ago.
