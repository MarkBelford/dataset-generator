I always thought GD's Fighter plants were in Long Island.
No, Northrup has a plant on Long Island.
I don't think Northrup ever had a plant on Long Island. The two main airframe
manufacturers there were Fairchild Republic which closed its doors after the
T 46 cancellation, and Grumman which is still hanging on last I time I called .
I think Sperry also started there. If you're ever in the area check out the
Cradle of Aviation Museum at Mitchell field now mostly parking lots behind the
Nassau Coliseum and the community college . Good display of vehicles from Long
Island, including a LEM flight article.
