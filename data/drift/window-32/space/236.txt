Can these questions be answered for a previous
instance, such as the Gehrels 3 that was mentioned in an earlier posting
Orbital Elements of Comet 1977VII from Dance files
p au 3.424346
e 0.151899
i 1.0988
cap omega 0 243.5652
W 0 231.1607
epoch 1977.04110
Also, perihelions of Gehrels3 were:
April 1973 83 jupiter radii
August 1970 3 jupiter radii
Where 1 Jupiter radius 71,000 km 44,000 mi 0.0005 AU. So the
1970 figure seems unlikely to actually be anything but a perijove.
Is that the case for the 1973 figure as well
Sorry, perijoves .I'm not used to talking this language.
