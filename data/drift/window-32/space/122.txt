Hey What happened to the solar sail race that was supposed to be
for Columbus 500
I am looking for any information concerning projects involving Solar
Sails. I understand that the JPL did an extensive study on the subject
back in the late 70's but I am having trouble gathering such information.
Are there any groups out there currently involved in such a project
