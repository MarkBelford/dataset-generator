A while ago I saw some translucent pads, about 6 x8 or so that
could be plugged into something and they would glow. One was red,
another green, another blue. Interresting. I was wondering if anyone
would have a feed on anything of this nature, and of the price.
oh, the pads were rubber like and were floppy like, about 1cm thick or
so.
Thanks.
