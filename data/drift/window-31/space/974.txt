To say that visible light astronomy is already a dying field is
pure hokum. To use the logic that things are already bad, so it doesn't
matter if it gets worse is absurd. Maybe common sense and logic
are the dying fields.

Ok, so those scientists can get around the atmosphere with fancy
computer algorythims, but have you looked ad the Hubble results, the
defects of the mirror are partially correctable with software see
those jupiter pictures for results , but is the effects are completely
reversable, why is there going to be a shuttle mission to fix it

The main effect of the spherical aberration problems with the
primary mirror was to drive the computer engineers to develop the image
processing software that much faster. When they use the same deconvolution
software on the images from the fixed Hubble, be ready for some
incredible results There is every reason to believe that the results will
exceed the original specs by a fair margin.
Adaptive optics is a combination of hardware and software. It works
realtime, not after the fact, as is the case with Hubble. You might be
interested to know this technology has made it to the amateur market, in
the form of the AO 2 Adaptive Optics System. Starting on page 52 of the
April, 1993 Sky Telescope is a three page review of this new product.
It lists for $1,290. The article states: The AO 2 Adaptive Optics System
comes in a handy soft plastic case that a three year old could carry
around. Even though this device is really only good for the brightest
objects, it could cope with image movements of up to 0.8 millimeter
in the telescope's focal plane. Now just imagine how well this infant
technology will do in a few years, especially in a dedicated system that
has hundreds of thousands of dollars, and many man hours invested in its
development.
