when soaking in water . Lasers are slightly sharper, but the only
instance where I needed precise layouts was Printed Circuit Board
Transparencies for PhotoEtching. I found a Textronix color Phaser
Postscript Thermal Wax Transfer to work the best to make PCB
negatives directly onto a transparency.
Did the deskjet work at all when printing on transparencies If it
did, what sort of resolution could it manage
