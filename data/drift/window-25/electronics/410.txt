What the world needs is a meter that won't let you change ranges or
turn it on off with a lead stuck in the amps jack a little bit of
clever plastic detailing would take care of this and make the world
safer for electricans, anyway.
Not that I've ever put a meter on the wrong range into a live
circuit, no, not me.not more than a dozen times, anyway.

The Fluke 87 beeps at you if you try to take it out of a current measuring
range while there is still a lead plugged in to the current sense socket.
this should solve your problem unless you are in a noisy environment.
