Why not build a inflatable space dock.
discussion of pros and cons deleted
These are some of the technical difficulties which the LLNL proposal
for an inflatable space station dealt with to varying degrees of
success.
Could someone give me the references to the LLNL proposal I've been meaning
to track it down in conjuntion with something I'm working on. It's not
directly related to space stations, but I think many of the principles will
carry over.
