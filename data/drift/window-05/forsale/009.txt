RESIDENTIAL LOT FOR SALE
I have a nice residential lot available. It is approx
imately 1 2 acre in size. It is located in the development
called Belvedere Plantation in Pender County, eastern North
Carolina, north of Wilmington. The lot is near the Intra
Coastal Waterway. Golf and tennis are located on the
development property. Belvedere Plantation also has a mar
ina facility on the ICW. This lot is nearby to all of the
facilities mentioned.
I own the lot outright but it does not look like I will
get back to the area anytime soon. I would like to sell it
for that reason. Make an offer.
If interested please send E mail.
