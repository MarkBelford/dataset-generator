has anybody implements an RPC server in the HP Xwindows In SUN Xview, there
is a notify enable rpc svc call that automatically executes the rpc processes
when it detects an incoming request. I wonder if there is a similar function in
HP X motif that perform the same function.
I've been using the xrpc package for about a year now. I believe I got it from
export.
