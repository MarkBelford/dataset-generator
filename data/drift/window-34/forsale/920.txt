I just wanted to let you know that there are a few honest and good people out
there even outside of Iowa . I'm sorry if anyone thinks that I am wasting
space, but I thought you might want some relief from the So and so is a thief
posts. Not that I think we shouldn't hear about the bad deals, but it would be
nice to hear some good news once in a while.
This was nice of Kevin to post this. But just so no one is misled, the
VAST MAJORITY of usenetters are honest and good people. In fact, in
the latest study, 99.7% of all net.deals went off smoothly without a
hitch. It's just that the few bad ones are what get all the publicity.
Agreed. I have yet to run into a problem in deals over the net
and I have bought things from CDs plenty to a full computer.
The only small problem that I have had was with UPS rather than
the seller. Besides, complaints are always what get the
publicity.when something goes wrong, people complain. Rarely
have I seen posts stating how well a deal went through. I guess
Kevin is practically a first
I'd rather be swimming.
