you might try
Computer Aided Circuit Analysis Using SPICE by Walter Banzhaf,
at bookstores, paperback, $33, lots of examples. Dr. Banzhaf
is a teacher.
Is there another book. I have this one and don't find it helpfull in
learning Spice. It would make a good reference book but I found it lacking
for learning Spice. Are there any others
