I was wondering if people had any good uses for old
256k SIMMs. I have a bunch of them for the Apple Mac
and I know lots of other people do to. I have tried to
sell them but have gotten NO interest.
So, if you have an inovative use or want to buy
some SIMMs 8 , I would be very interested in hearing
about it.
One of the guys at work takes 20 of them, uses cyano acrylate glue to make
five four wide panels then constructs a box, with bottom, to use as a
pencil holder.
Or, if you've got some entreprenuerial sp spirit, get a cheapy
clear plastic box, mount the simm inside, and sell it as a 'Pet SIMM'
I'm sure there are plenty of suckers out there who would go
for it
