I know this is a long shot, but does anyone know what solvent I should
use to clean duct tape adhesive from carpet
Someone taped wires to the carpet, and now it is time to move out.
Is the solvent the same as what's used to clean up the goop in coax
whatever that is . but it just barely ties this query into
sci.electronics
Thanks for your help
Best regards,
