FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS ON SCI.SPACE SCI.ASTRO
INTRODUCTION
This series of linked messages is periodically posted to the Usenet
groups sci.space and sci.astro in an attempt to provide good answers to
frequently asked questions and other reference material which is worth
preserving. If you have corrections or answers to other frequently asked
questions that you would like included in this posting, send email to
Jon Leech .
If you don't want to see the FAQ, add 'Frequently Asked Questions' to
your KILL file for this group if you're not reading this with a newsreader
that can kill articles by subject, you're out of luck .
The FAQ volume is excessive right now and will hopefully be trimmed down
by rewriting and condensing over time. The FAQ postings are available in
the Ames SPACE archive in FAQ faq .
Good summaries will be accepted in place of the answers given here. The
point of this is to circulate existing information, and avoid rehashing old
answers. Better to build on top than start again. Nothing more depressing
than rehashing old topics for the 100th time. References are provided
because they give more complete information than any short generalization.
Questions fall into three basic types:
1 Where do I find some information about space
Try your local public library first. The net is not a good place to ask
for general information. Ask INDIVIDUALS by email if you must. There
are other sources, use them, too. The net is a place for open ended
discussion.
2 I have an idea which would improve space flight
Hope you aren't surprised, but 9,999 out of 10,000 have usually been
thought of before. Again, contact a direct individual source for
evaluation. NASA fields thousands of these each day.
3 Miscellanous queries.
These are addressed on a case by case basis in the following series of
FAQ postings.
SUGGESTIONS FOR BETTER NETIQUETTE
Read news.announce.newusers if you're on Usenet.
Minimize cross references, Do you REALLY NEED to
Edit Subject: lines, especially if you're taking a tangent.
Send mail instead, avoid posting follow ups. 1 mail message worth
100 posts .
Internet mail readers: send requests to add drop to SPACE REQUEST
not SPACE.
Read all available articles before posting a follow up. Check all
references.
Cut down attributed articles leave only the points you're
responding to remove signatures and headers . Summarize
Put a return address in the body signature of your message mail
or article , state your institution, etc. Don't assume the
reply' function of mailers will work.
Use absolute dates. Post in a timely way. Don't post what everyone
will get on TV anyway.
Some editors and window systems do character count line wrapping:
keep lines under 80 characters for those using ASCII terminals
use carriage returns .
INDEX TO LINKED POSTINGS
I've attempted to break the postings up into related areas. There isn't
a keyword index yet the following lists the major subject areas in each
posting. Only those containing astronomy related material are posted to
sci.astro indicated by ' ' following the posting number .

CREDITS
Eugene Miya started a series of linked FAQ postings some years ago which
inspired and was largely absorbed into this set.
Peter Yee and Ron Baalke have and continue to spend a lot of their own
time setting up the SPACE archives at NASA Ames and forwarding official
NASA announcements.
Many other people have contributed material to this list in the form of
old postings to sci.space and sci.astro which I've edited. Please let me
know if corrections need to be made. Contributors I've managed to keep
track of are:
