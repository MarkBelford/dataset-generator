Apartment for rent in downtown Moscow
2 room furnished apartment in a very nice location. 5 minutes walk to
Belorusskaya subway station. Walking distance to Kremlin, major shopping
centers, theaters, restaurants, and government buildings.
Hmmm. Interesting. What do you mean by WALKING distance I lived in
Moscow for 21 years, and if I am 5 minutes walk to Belorusskaya
subway station, I CANNOT be walking distance to Kremlin. Unless
1 hour of walking is what you mean. By the way, what is
the price I may plan a trip there not sure yet, though in
late summer.
