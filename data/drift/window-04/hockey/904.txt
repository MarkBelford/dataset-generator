With the recent demise of the Chicago Blawkhawks much to my delight I
noticed their 8 game playoff losing streak 4 to the Pens last year, and
now 4 to the Blues and I am wondering what the NHL record for consecutive
losses is, if there even is one.
I'm pretty sure that the Hawks have at least a 9 game losing streak, since
they've had to have lost a series since their last championship whenever that
was
Basically, I need something else to rag on my Hawks fan friend with :
Mike, the insomniaced
Yes Rush Marillion Emerson, Lake and Palmer Genesis Dream Theater
Mike Weintraub, aka Jvi on IRC .sig Quote du Jour
Life is like a scissors paper
stone game, none of the answers
The American University is always right, but sometimes
Washington, DC each one is Neil Peart, Rush
Go Philadelphia Phillies and Vancouver Canucks 3 down, 13 to go
