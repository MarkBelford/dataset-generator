I am looking for any information concerning projects involving Solar
Sails. I understand that the JPL did an extensive study on the subject
back in the late 70's but I am having trouble gathering such information.
Are there any groups out there currently involved in such a project

I know someone had long talks about Solar Sails early this year and late last
year.Also about Solar Sailing. Not sure who captured it if possible.
I think it was one of the regulars who had most or all the data
I think I started the latest round or the late last year round. But the topic
has been around here, off and on for a year or two.
