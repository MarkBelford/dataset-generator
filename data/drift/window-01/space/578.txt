I have 19 2 MB worth uuencode'd GIF images contain charts outlining
one of the many alternative Space Station designs being considered in
Crystal City. .
I just posted the GIF files out for anonymous FTP on server ics.uci.edu.
You can retrieve them from:
The last two are scanned color photos the others are scanned briefing
charts.
These will be deleted by the ics.uci.edu system manager in a few days,
so now's the time to grab them if you're interested. Sorry it took
me so long to get these out, but I was trying for the Ames server,
but it's out of space.
