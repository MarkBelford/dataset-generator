It is my impression that net etiquette does not allow companies to
use the net to directly advertise their products.
In addition to improper etiquette, this product is a mailing list
used for generating junk mail.
Am I correct in assuming this is improper, and if so, what can be
done to penalize such an improper use

Well, Dale, I'd say offhand Keel hauling would work pretty
well.we haven't had a good keel hauling in a long time. Sorry, it came up in a conversation yesterday and, well, I just love that phrase.
Or maybe just ask for folks to flood the guys mailbox with
the FAQ for net etiquitte.sort of poetic justice for all the junk mail
he was trying to generate anyway.
