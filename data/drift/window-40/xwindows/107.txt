Hi,
I wonder if it is possible for a parent window to paint over the area of
its childs. If it is not, then how could it be possible to implement a
rubberband across multiple xwindows to select the objects that are
displayed one in each window

If you specify the rootwindow when you are creating your GC. You may
use Xlib to draw over multiple windows.
I have an application that does something similar for rubber banding.
curs move XCreateFontCursor disp data, XC crosshair
geom vals.foreground blck pixl grey dark
geom vals.plane mask AllPlanes
geom vals.line width 0
geom vals.function GXxor
geom vals.subwindow mode IncludeInferiors
evnt mask GCForeground GCPlaneMask GCLineWidth GCFunction
GCSubwindowMode
geom gcon XCreateGC disp data, root iden, evnt mask, geom vals
later I can move the rubber band or bands using the following logic
void Tselect::move bands int delt xloc, int delt yloc

XDrawRectangle disp data, root iden, geom gcon,
sele pntr rootx, sele pntr rooty,
sele pntr xlnth, sele pntr ylnth undraw old one
sele pntr papax delt xloc
sele pntr papay delt yloc
sele pntr rootx delt xloc
sele pntr rooty delt yloc
XDrawRectangle disp data, root iden, geom gcon,
sele pntr rootx, sele pntr rooty,
sele pntr xlnth, sele pntr ylnth draw new one
more stuff deleted
hope this helps
