Is there an Xt call to give me my application context
I am fixing up an X Motif program, and am trying to use XtAppAddTimeOut,
whose first argument is the app context. What call can I use
to give me this value
You can get the ApplicationContext associated with a widget by calling
XtWidgetToApplicationContext.
