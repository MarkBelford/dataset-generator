Could you give examples of privately funded ones
If you believe 1492 the film , Columbus had substantial private

But greater than these is Banking.
Heck, some of his ships were loaners. One was owned by a Basque.
you know, one of those groups that probably crossed the Atlantic
before Columbus came along .
