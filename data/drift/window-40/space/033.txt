According the IAU Circular 5744, Comet Shoemaker Levy 1993e, may be
temporarily in orbit around Jupiter. The comet had apparently made a
close flyby of Jupiter sometime in 1992 resulting in the breakup of the
comet. Attempts to determine the comet's orbit has been complicated by
the near impossibility of measuring the comet's center of mass.
Am I missing something what does knowing the comet's center
of mass do for you in orbit determination

I'm not sure, but it almost sounds like they can't figure out where the
nucleus is within the coma. If they're off by a couple hundred
miles, well, you can imagine the rest.
