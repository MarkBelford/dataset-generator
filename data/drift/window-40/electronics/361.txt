During the nuclear fission reaction the uranium fuel can get hot enough
to melt. When this happens the liquid uranium is pumped to the cooling
tower where it is sprayed into the air.
Contact with the cool outside air
will condense the mist and it will fall back to the cooling tower floor.
There it is collected by a cleaning crew using shop vacs and is then
reformed into pellets for reactor use the next day.
Another April 1 posting. Ahhh.
