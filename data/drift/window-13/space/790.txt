I am taking a course entitled Exploring Science Using Internet .
For our final project, we are to find a compendium of Internet resources
dealing with a science related topic. I chose Astronomy. Anyway, I was
wondering if anyone out there knew of any interesting resources on Internet
that provide information on Astronomy, space, NASA, or anything like that.

Try doing a keyword search under Gopher using Veronica or accessing a
World Wide Web server. Also finger for a list
of Internet resources which includes 2 3 sites with Space specific
information. I am sure Ron Baalke will have told you about what is
available at JPL etc.
