We're talking about an orbiting ad here, not some little point
of light that puts a streak or two on a photograph. It should have been
clear that anything used for advertisement is going to be a bit larger than
a point source. Even if this was not clear there's a previous post on this
topic that makes it clear:

In the New York Times on Sunday May 9th in the week in review
section there was a report of a group called Space Marketing
in Atlanta, Georgia who is planning to put up a one mile wide
reflective Earth orbiting satelite which will appear as large
and as bright as the Moon and carry some sort of advertising.
From the description I've read, it's prob. only going to be
as bright as Jupiter. Anything else is probably hype from the
opponents or wishful thinking from the sponsors.
If we could do something as bright as the full moon that soon,
that cheap, the CIS would have done it already.
