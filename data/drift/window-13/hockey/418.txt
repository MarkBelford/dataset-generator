You'll have a hard time selling any sport to a community that
can't play it on account of availability or financial reasons.
Hockey is pretty much a sport for the white and well off.
What is this crap I'm only interested in intelligent discussion. If you
can't answer my question, just say so. Can anyone else answer the ques.
It's not really crap you know. only half crap From what i
understand it's very expensive to play hockey south of the border.
actually it's not that cheap up hear either. though once you have all the
equipement it's not more than $300 a year. actually i haven' played in
about 8 years so i could be off a bit. In the states, where ice time
is considerably more expensive it can cost over a thousand a year. compare
this to baseball and you'll see that hockey is a sport for the well to do.
And this brings up the fact that the well to do in the US are majority white.
BTW: what was the original question. i think it has to do with the Hispanic
communtiy and playing hockey.
