Tom Moffat says:
If the Oilers move to Hamilton what division will they play in .
And won't they have to change their name to the Steelers or something.
The only significant deposits of oil around Hamilton are those caused by
the tire fire a few years back.
Then again if the NBA can have the Utah Jazz or the L.A. Lakers think about
it, what lakes are in L.A. then I guess the NHL can have the Hamilton Oilers.
