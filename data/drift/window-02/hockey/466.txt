It is really annoying to see all of these
predictions on the Net. Who really cares
who you think will win Please stop with
the predictions, we all know the Caps are
going to win the Cup, so let it go at that.

Yeah, but first they have to deal with the Devils,
who've had their number all year. I'm not saying
the Caps aren't a good team they've been a thorn
on the Habs side for the past 10 years , just
that they won't get past NJ.
