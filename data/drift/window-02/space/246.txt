In article Henry Spencer,
The National Air Space Museum has both the prototype and the film.
When I was there, some years ago, they had the prototype on display and
the film continuously repeating.
Great I'll visit the National Air and Space Museum at the end of the
month with my wife, who was also working at General Atomic at the time.
Once again netnews has enriched my life.
Sorry to put a damper on your plans, but I was there three weeks ago and
it wasn't there. Not that I would have known to look for it, of course,
but I combed the space exhibits pretty thoroughly and something like that
would have caught my attention instantly.
This is news. This is your Peter Scott, NASA JPL Caltech
brain on news. Any questions
