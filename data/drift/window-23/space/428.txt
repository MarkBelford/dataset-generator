Would they buy it, given that it's a lot more expensive, and not
much more impressive, than putting a large set of several km
inflatable billboards in LEO or in GEO, visible 24 hours from your
key growth market . I'll do that for only $5bn and the changes of
identity .
I've heard of sillier things, like a well known utility company
wanting to buy an 'automated' boiler cleaning system which uses as many
operators as the old system, and which rumour has it costs three million
more per unit. Automation is more 'efficient' although by what scale they are
not saying.
