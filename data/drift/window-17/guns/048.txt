If she needs a gun right now, why doesn't she already have one
You are the victim of a cut and run purse snatcher. He makes off
with your purse, containing your ID, your house keys. and your gun.
So you're saying she can RUN RIGHT INTO A STORE, BUY A GUN, RUN BACK
OUTSIDE AND SHOOT THE GUY IN THE BACK AS HE RUNS OFF This doesn't
No, he's saying she just lost her gun and she wants to buy another
so that as she sits home alone tonight, she's not a sitting duck to
any bastard who wants to break in.
In fact, the situation is more grim that that, even. The purse snatcher
now has her home address. If the woman lives alone, she is in great
personal danger.
