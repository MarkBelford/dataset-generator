an image of the moon has been caught in a weather satellite images of the earth.
it appears in both the 0430 1500UT ir and visual images of the earth.
the GIF images can be down loaded from vmd.cso.uiuc.edu and are named
CI043015.GIF and CV043015.GIF for the IR and visual images respectively.
pretty cool pictures in the ir it's saturated but in the visual image
details on the moon are viewable.
Near midsummer, you can see the relfection of the Sun in the ocean.
Also during solar eclise you can see the shadow of the sun move
across the clouds.
Speaking of which, a paper was out a few years ago about a
weather sat imaging a lunar eclipse are those images
uploaded anywhere I could dig out the reference if there's interest.
