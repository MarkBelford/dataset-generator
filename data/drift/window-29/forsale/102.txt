5.25 1.2MB and 3.5 1.44 Drives.new. planned on building machine, but

Carl,
What Brand of drives are these Do you have documentation
I'll go $40.00 shipping if you have documentation.
do not pay $40 for floppy drives. they are about $40 new.
also, you do not need documentation for floppies. installation
for these things are idiot proof.
just some advice.
