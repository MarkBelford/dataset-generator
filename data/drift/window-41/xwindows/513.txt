Please igore my previouse calculation mistaked. Please see the correct
calculation. Sorry
I created a pixmap or drawable window, then used XDrawLine function
drawed a line as below fingure:
width 300
height 300
I created the pixmap or drawable window only with size 300x300.
But I draw line from p1 x1 270,y1 100 to p2 x2 500,y2 800 .
My question is, dose the XDrawLine function can finger out that correct
p3 x3 and y3 for me If you calculate x3 and y3.
x3 300
art tan 500 270 800 100 18.19 degrees
y3 100 300 270 tan 191.29 191 integer
How do I prove XDrawLine give me the right x3, y3 or not
Please don't ask me why I don't created a 900x900 pixmap. No, I don't
wan to.
Thanks in advance
