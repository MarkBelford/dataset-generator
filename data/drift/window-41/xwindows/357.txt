Can some one please explain to me why the following piece of code
causes twm or tvtwm to dump core .
In particular, I am interested in knowing whether this behavior is
caused by a bug in my reasoning, or if it is a bug in twm.
If anything a client does causes twm to dump core, it's a bug in twm.
Window managers should never ever crash.
Would if only it were true .
If only MIT would fix the $ twm InstallWindowColormaps crash bug
once and for all, then I could say that I've almost unable to crash either
twm or tvtwm , which would be a remarkable feat and most desirable to
boot. I mean, this bug has only been reported, oh, a zillion times by now .
Now servers , on the other hand . want to crash an OpenWindows 3.0 xnews
server at will Just do an 'xbiff xrm XBiff shapeWindow: on '. Blammo.
