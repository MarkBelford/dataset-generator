I know this is a long shot, but does anyone know what solvent I should
use to clean duct tape adhesive from carpet
Someone taped wires to the carpet, and now it is time to move out.
I don't know for sure that this will work, but you might try MEK methyl
ethyl keytone . It worked getting the stickum left over from shelf paper,
and is available at paint stores. Use a carbon gas mask and lots of
ventilation this stuff really stinks
