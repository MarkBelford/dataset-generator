I have 19 2 MB worth uuencode'd GIF images contain charts outlining
one of the many alternative Space Station designs being considered in
Crystal City. .
I just posted the GIF files out for anonymous FTP on server ics.uci.edu.
You can retrieve them from:
The last two are scanned color photos the others are scanned briefing
charts.
These will be deleted by the ics.uci.edu system manager in a few days,
so now's the time to grab them if you're interested. Sorry it took
me so long to get these out, but I was trying for the Ames server,
but it's out of space.
But now I need to clarify the situation. The incoming directory on
ics.uci.edu does NOT allow you to do an ls command. The files are
there I just checked on 04 28 93 at 9:35 CDT , and you can get them
don't forget the binary mode , but you can't ls in the
incoming directory.
A further update: Mark's design made the cover of Space News this week
as one of the design alternatives which was rejected. But he's still
in there plugging. I wish him luck using ET's as the basis of a
Space Station has been a good idea for a long time.
May the best design win.
