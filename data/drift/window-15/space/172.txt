If anyone knows anyone else who would like to get sci.space,
but doesn't have an Internet feed or has a cryptic Internet
feed , I would be willing to feed it to them.
Kudos to Mark for his generous offer, but there already exists a
large email based forwarding system for sci.space posts: Space Digest.
It mirrors sci.space exactly, and provides simple two way communication.
