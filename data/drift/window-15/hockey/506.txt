Today at the World Championships in Munich, Canada scored an
impressive 3 1 victory over the defending World Champs, Sweden.
In the game I have seen yesterday in the Olympiahalle of Munich
Canada won 4 1 against Sweden The last goal for Canada was at 19:59 in
the 3rd period. Maybe you shouldn't go and get you another beer
before the game is over and then post imaginary results.
