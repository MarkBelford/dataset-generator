MS DOS 6.0 Upgrade for sale best offer over $45
opened, unregistered
So, does anyone care to enlighten us whether DOS6.0 is worth upgrading to
How good is it's compression, and can it be turned on off at will
Any other nice nasty features
According to reports, if you don't have DOS yet, and don't have any
utilities QEMM, Stacker, PCTools, Norton, . then DOS6 may be worth it.
For people who have DOS5, and some sort of utility, DOS6 doesn't offer
much. You'd never know it from the usual hype that marketing is able
to create, however. :
