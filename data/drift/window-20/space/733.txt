But try to land a shuttle with that big huge telescope in the
back and you could have problems. The shuttle just isn't designed to land
with that much weight in the payload.
Is HST really that much heavier than a Spacelab
I can't speak to sheer mass, but part of the problem is that HST
wasn't built to ever be brought back down. It's not built for those
kinds of 'jolt' forces and there is no support cradle for it which is
additional weight that would be required.
Just to throw it out there: The mass of the telescope is 11,600 kg
25,500 lb . I do not know what Space lab weighs, but I believe it is
less. Can anyone verify
Also, remember that weight was not the only concern, as many others have
noted, just one possible concern. I was responding to a statement that
if you can boost it, why can't you land it. Those are too different
problems.
