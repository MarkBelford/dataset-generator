Hmmm.
What is the problem with parallel port security keys I haven't used anything
that had hardware key copy protection schemes, so I don't know what the
drawbacks are. I know the companies that make them claim they're uncrackable,
but I've seen cracks of AutoDesk 3d studio floating around I don't have one
so don't ask and I had heard that it had parralel port keys.
If you put another computer on the port instead of the key, you can hack
them by reading what happens. So I've been told, I've never seen this done
but I think it's possible. You'd need some hardware knowledge and some
software to read the port
my apologies if I rambled, but vi inhibits my communication skills greatly.
