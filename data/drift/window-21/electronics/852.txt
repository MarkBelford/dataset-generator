Nothing, but if you read my WHOLE suggestion, I'm saying that you register
via MAIL by mailing in your registration card, THEN the company send you
the patch which includes the info you put on the registration card.
The problem with this scheme, is that when I buy a game, I want to play it
THAT day.mailing a card to and from California would probably take a week
or more.
I didn't say the program is DISABLED, did I I HATE it when people
take my words out of context. I mean that once you have installed it,
you cannot DEinstall it without registering it, or transfer it to another
machine, or SOME SORT OF LIMITATION the author will decide , WHICH WILL
BE REMOVED WHEN THE PROGRAM IS REGISTERED.
