Can someone please remind me who said a well known quotation
He was sitting atop a rocket awaiting liftoff and afterwards, in answer to
the question what he had been thinking about, said approximately half a
million components, each has to work perfectly, each supplied by the lowest
bidder.
Sounds similar to something Wally Schirra said.
