From article , by
Ira H. Fuchs :
Is there a readily available solvent that does a good job at removing
the
corrosion encrustation that collects on the battery terminals usually
the
cathode when using alkaline batteries or more accurately, when NOT
using
them for a long time
generally, the corrosion is a signal that it's time to send them
of to the recyclers, but if you're that desperate or cheap try
baking soda and a wire brush. use gloves and goggles, please
Sorry, I meant the terminals in the device not on the batteries which are
obviously quite dead .
