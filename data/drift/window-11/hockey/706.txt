Ok, Buffalo fans. I am a Red Wings fan, but am amazed at how the Sabres are
beating up on the Bruins. Is there any reason for this Is it Grant Fuhr or
Mogilny and Lafontaine I would like to hear from you since I do not know
much
about the Sabres.

Pure and Simple, Grant Fuhr is money. He has been awesome in the playoffs,
especially last night. But Mogilny has been scoring well, and his russian
friend Kymlev sp has also done well. But Fuhr is the biggest reason they
are winning, and the difference between this year's team and previous years.
