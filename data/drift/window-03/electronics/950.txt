Does anyone know of any type of acceleration sensor that has
an electrical output of any sort It would only have to sense
acceleration in one direction.
Thanx, Mike

Accelerometers are not cheap, mainly because the outputs are fairly linear
with respect to acceleration. You don't say what the range of acceleration
you want to measure is, and there are other ways in which to measure it
other than using an accelerometer. Additional information would be helpful
to anyone who may respond.
Call, if you wish.
