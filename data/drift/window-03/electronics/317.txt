I'm looking for an IC that will convert RS232 voltage levels to TTL voltage
levels. Something relatively inexpensive would be nice, too. Anyone have
a suggestion Thanks.
Well it looks as if Digi Key sells a chip with the number ICL232 that does what
you want. They are selling it for about $3.50.
Hope this helps.
