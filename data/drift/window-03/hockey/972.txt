Speaking of Paddock what's he doing slagging Sandlak If Sandlak puts
his mind to it, he can be a physical presence and waking him up might be a
real mistake.
Isn't Sandbag out with an injury now anyways Perhaps Paddock
meant to say that Momesso was the cheap short artist. After all, that
would make more sense.
