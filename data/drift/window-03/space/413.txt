Tonigth a TV journal here in Brasil announced that an object,
beyond Pluto's orbit, was found by an observatory at Hawaii. They
named the object Karla.
The program said the object wasn't a gaseous giant planet, and
should be composed by rocks and ices.
Can someone confirm these information Could this object be a
new planet or a Kuiper object
Thanks in advance.
Francisco.
