I hear insert favorite rumor here that it will supposedly coincide
with the Atlanta Olympics.
Even worse, the city of Atlanta has a proposal before it to rent space on this
orbiting billboard. Considering the caliber of people running this city,
there's no telling what we're going to have leering down at us from orbit.
