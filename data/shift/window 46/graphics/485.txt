Let's be serious. I'm working on a radiosity package, written in C .
I would like to make it public domain. I'll announce it in c.g. the minute
I finished it.
That were the good news. The bad news: It'll take another 2 months at least
to finish it.
Please note that there are some radiosity packages in my Resource Listing
under the Subject 3: FTP list
Greetings,
Nick.
