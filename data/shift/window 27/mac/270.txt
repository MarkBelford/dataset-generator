I'm sure Intel and Motorola are competing neck and neck for
crunch power, but for a given clock speed, how do we rank the
following from 1st to 6th :
486 68040
386 68030
286 68020
While you're at it, where will the following fit into the list:
68060
Pentium
PowerPC
And about clock speed: Does doubling the clock speed double the
overall processor speed And fill in the 's below:
68030 MHz 68040 MHz
Thanks very much. I'd appreciate hearing any further explanations
from any experienced folks out there, too
P.S. Folks have been having trouble replying to me lately with the reply
command. Try typing my address by hand and it should work. Thanks
