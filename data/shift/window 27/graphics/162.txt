Boy, this will be embarassing if it is trivial or an FAQ:
center and radius, exactly fitting those points I know how to do it
for a circle from 3 points , but do not immediately see a
straightforward way to do it in 3 D. I have checked some
geometry books, Graphics Gems, and Farin, but am still at a loss
Please have mercy on me and provide the solution
Off the top of my head, I might try:
Given: p 1, p 2, p 3, p 4
Find: p c center of sphere determined by p 1, ., p 4 ,
dist p c, p i radius
p c is the same distance from our four points, so
dist p c,p 1 dist p c,p 2 dist p c,p 3 dist p c,p 4
Of course, we can square the whole thing to get rid of square roots:
distsq p c,p 1 distsq p c,p 2 distsq p c,p 3 distsq p c,p 4
Plug in the variables into the distance formula, simplify, and the
x 2 c, y 2 c, and z 2 c terms cancel out, leaving you with three
linearly independent equations and three unknowns x c, y c, z c .
Solve using your favorite method. :
All the best,
