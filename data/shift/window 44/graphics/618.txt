Has anyone got multiverse to work
I have built it on 486 svr4, mips svr4s and Sun SparcStation.
There seems to be many bugs in it. The 'dogfight' and 'dactyl' simply do nothing
After fixing a bug where a variable is defined twice in two different modules One needed
setting to static else the client core dumped

I've tried compiling it on several SPARCstations with gcc 2.22. After
fixing up a few bugs 3 missing constant definitions plus a couple of
other things I got it to compile link, but after starting client
server I just get a black window sometimes the client core dumps,
sometimes the server, sometimes I get a broken pipe, sometimes it
just sits there doing nothing although I occassionally get the
cursor to become a cross hair in dog fight, but that's it. I've
sent word to the author plus what I did to fix it last week, but
no reply as yet.
