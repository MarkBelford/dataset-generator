I'm looking for a program which is able to display 24 bits
images. We are using a Sun Sparc equipped with Parallax
graphics board running X11.
Utah raster toolkit using getx11. Convert your sun raster files presumably to
ppm with the pbm toolkit then convert ppm to utah rle format with ppmtorle which
is provided in the toolkit.
Or just use the URT tool: rastorle.
I seem to remember that Xloadimage can do 24 bit servers too.
Yes, both it and the newer xli can.
