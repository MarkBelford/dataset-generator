I have a little question:
I need to convert RGB coded Red Green Blue colors into HVS coded
Hue Value Saturnation colors. Does anyone know which formulas to
use
I have a little answer:
See Foley, van Dam, Feiner, and Hughes, Computer Graphics: Principles
and Practice, Second Edition .
If people would read this book, 75 percent of the questions in this
froup would disappear overnight.
