Are there any TIFF to anything programs out there for the IBM
Our scanner works into TIFF, and I can view it on CSHOW 8.1, but
all of my other programs read errors. Are there any basic Tiff to
JPEG, GIF, PCX, BMP, etc.
Try WinJPEG on oak.oakland.edu:pub msdos windows3 winjp210.zip
It has more TIFF support than graphics workshop. It also converts to
all the above formats.
