Can anybody tell me what exactly Windows 3.1 does to the COM ports
Why can't I run a single communication program under Windows I have ProComm ,
QuickLink, COMMO neither of them respond to modem commands after the
connection has finally been established, although I'm still able to manage
Vick.
This is one of the trickiest problems w Win 3.1 . Personally I run
Telix 3.2 for DOS under Windows just fine and 've been waiting for the Win
version froever. : , but I have to admit I am the exception to the rule:
I have tried installing various DOS comm progs on friends' machines, most of
them w big problems. Some of the stuff you have to lookout for:
1 ALWAYS run the prog thru a .PIF, never by calling its .exe, 2 In the .PIF
always toggle on lock application memory actually this is something
MS points out in the readme.wri file, and is especially critical for downloading
3 Go under Ctrl Panel 386 enh and check for all your COM ports 'Alway Warn'
it will help u w. debugging this thing and it's 'healthier' 4 Check where
are u running the mouse from com port 5 check the com port addresses from
your BIOS setup and from Ctrl Panel Ports Setup Advanced.
These might help u. If yu still have problems, get $100 and buy Procomm Win.,
Hope it helps somehow.
