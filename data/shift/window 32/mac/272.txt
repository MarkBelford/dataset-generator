Doesn't a 1 MB SIMM have about 1024 1024 8 moving flip flops
They don't move, to anybody much bigger than an electron :
Dynamic RAM is not based on flip flops there's basically a single
transistor and capacitor to store each bit Static RAM is based on
flip flops, and is much more expensive and much less dense. And
neither has any parts that move , if electrons and thermal expansion
are ignored.
noah
