Does anyone know of a program or utility that will
enable the Mac to read Unix i.e. NeXT 3.5 in. disks
Thanks,
Warren
I don't know the answer to your direct question, but if the Mac Superdrive can
read MS DOS disks can it then you can transfer files between the NeXT and
a Mac by using MS DOS formatted disks since the NeXT can read write that
format. And if you're interested in transferring files, you can also do it
over the serial port using kermit.
