Stay in school. You have a lot to learn.
Learn what I know that 3 million dollars is A LOT of money. I
know
Rickey Henderson doesn't have a career out of baseball. I know if
didn't have baseball, he wouldn't be making near the money he is
now.
And Michael Jackson, Jack Nicholson, and Bill Cosby wouldn't be
making near as much money if they weren't entertainers. So what's
your point
I just don't understand how some athlete, who only plays a sport
for a
living for millions of dollars, say he is not being paid enough.
If nobody will sign him for his asking price, he will be the one
hurting.
The A's will still win without him.
Will they You can't usually take away one of the team's best
players and still expect them to win. Or do you think the
Pirates will continue to win without Barry Bonds.
Remeber, many of these athletes have NOTHING if not for their
athletic
ability. NOTHING. They are getting paid MUCH more than most hard
working
citizens, and they are complaining of not enough pay.
So. Again, Jack Nicholson gets paid much more than most hard
working citizens and much more than Rickey Henderson for that
matter .
I don't have a problem with them making millions. My problem is
when the
say they aren't being paid enough, when they already get 3
million also,
their numbers get worse.
The reason the latter often happens is that many of these folks
start making the real big salaries late in their career, when they
are on the decline. There are exceptions, of course. Dave Parker
fell apart after making his first million because he put most
of that million up his nose.
