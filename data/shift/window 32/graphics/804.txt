Earlier today I read an ad for REAL 3D animation ray tracing software
and it looked very convincing to me.
Yes, it looks like very good indeed.
However, I don't own an Amiga and so I began to wonder, if there's a PC
version of it.
Nope.
Did I not hear that there maybe some ports of Real3D Version2
in the pipeline somewhere, Possibly Unix. Not too sure though
please put me straight.
