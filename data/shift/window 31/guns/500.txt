napalm, then let the wood stove inside ignite it.
As someone else has pointed out, why would the stove be in use on a warm day

Not that I agree with the original theory or anything, buuuuut:
Since their utilities were turned off they might be using wood stoves
to cook their meals.
But they also might have run out of fire wood maybe chopping up furnature .
They also may not have been cooking, but eating MREs and other
delicacies stored for just such an occation.
Just a thought.
