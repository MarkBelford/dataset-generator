I am trying obtain program to preprocess handwriting characters.
Like thining algorithm, graph alogrithm.
Do anyone know where I can obtain those
I usually use Algorithms for graphics and image processing by
Theodosios Pavlidis, but other people here got them same idea and now
3 of 4 copies in the libraries have been stolen
Another reference is Digital Image Processing by Gonzalez and
Wintz Wood, which is widely available but a little expensive $55
here I just checked today .
