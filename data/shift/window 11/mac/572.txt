Does anyone know if there is an ethernet card that takes advantage of the
A Rose extension
Hey what does the A Rose extension do anyway
A ROSE Apple Real Time Operating System Environment
This is a system extension for these NuBUS cards using the
MCP Macintosh Coprocessor Platform . The MCP cards are NuBUS cards with a
Motorola 68000 Processor and 512 KB RAM expandable to 1 Meg .
MCP is a development platform for hardware designers so they can use a card
with an own processor and thus the main processor isn't needed for these cards.
Currently the only cards I know are
the Apple TokenRing Card
the new Apple Ethernet Card
the Apple NuBUS serial card
Perhaps there are some third party cards, but I don't know.
