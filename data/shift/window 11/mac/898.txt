So, what does the net think Did the dealer just get one flaky
machine, or did Apple send the C610 out the door too early
Is your C610 working just great, or is it buggy too
My 610 is working like a charm. In fact, if 610's are flaky, I would consider it a great computer even if I had to return a couple to Apple to get a good one.
