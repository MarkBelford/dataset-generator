Deleted a lot of stuff
How do you convert this to a bit map
You're supposed to delete everything above the cut here mark, and
below the lower cut here mark, and uudecode it. but
I was not able to: unexpected end of file encountered at the last line.
could you please re post it, or tell be what I'm doing wrong
thanks,i.a.,
Mickey
