I have seen these numbers quoted before, and I have seen very specific
refutation of them quoted as well. If someone will be so kind as to
email the relevant information, I will write a letter to the editor of
the Co. Daily which might get published and send a copy to USN WR as
well.
Thanks to all who responded. The letter has been written making liberal
use of info provided by various net.folks and handed to the paper. I'll
post if it gets into the paper
