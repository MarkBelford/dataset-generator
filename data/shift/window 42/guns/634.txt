I predict that the outcome of the study of what went wrong with the
Federal Assault in Waco will result in future assaults of that type
being conducted as full scale military operations with explicit
shoot to kill directives.
You mean they aren't already Could have fooled me.
REMEMBER WACO
Who will the government decide to murder next Maybe you
Opinions are mine I don't care if you blame the University or the State.
