This may be a fairly routine request on here, but I'm looking for a fast
polygon routine to be used in a 3D game.
A fast polygon routine to do WHAT
To draw polygons of course. Its a VGA mode 13h 320x200 game, done in C and
ASM. I need a faster way to draw concave polygons that the method I have right
now, which is very slow.
