2 Having Bonds batting behind Williams means that Matt will get
more good pitches to hit. This is important since he struggles
so much with breaking balls. Opposing pitchers don't want to
walk Williams to get to Bonds.
I have to wonder if this good hitter behind you argument is really valid.
Has anyone done a study on this.
You want a study Look at Matt Williams the year after
Mitchell was gone. Look no further. Not a scientific
study, but it'll show the truth for Matt. Besides, Bonds
wants to bat 5th
I had thought that Williams batted after Mitchell. Wouldn't that show that
Williams does better at 5th rather than 4th
The point is moot, though, becase Clark pretty much demands to be 3rd
and, like you point out, Bonds does like to bat 5th. The only person
left to bat 4th is Williams.
