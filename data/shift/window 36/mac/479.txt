Is it possible, ie via creative cable splicing or whatever, to
hook a Syquest 44MB removable drive to a Mac
Is there any difference with the guts of the drive or is it
just cable differences
Thanks.

Many Companies package Syquest drives for the mac already. So unless you
are using one for the IBM world, Id buy a Mac ready Config.
