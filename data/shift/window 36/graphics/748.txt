Okay, I got enough replies about the Kubota Kenai Denali systems that I
will post a summary of their capabilities. .
GRAPHICS
Transform Modules 1 6 1 6
Frame Buffer Modules 5,10,20 5,10,20
Frame Buffer 1280x1024x24bit 1280x1024x24bit
double buffered double buffered
Z buffer 24 bit 24 bit
Alpha stencil 8 bit 8 bit
Paul Martz :
Does this mean they can either do alpha or stenciling, but not both
simultaneously
Stereo support yes yes
Other: both machines will double buffer or do
stereo output per window. Both have an
auxiliary video output that is RS 170A,
NTSC, and PAL
Paul Martz :
Same question again, does this mean they can either do double
buffering or stereo, but not both simultaneously
For both these questions, it's an inclusive or. Alpha plus stencil is
supported they're separate , as is double buffered stereo.
