Hi Folks,
Does anyone have a copy of Playmation they'd be willing to sell me. I'd
love to try it out, but not for the retail $$$.
Playmation is available direct from Anjon Associates for $299. It's hard
to beat that price. Also, you'd be better off with a newer version than
an older version that had bugs that have long since been clobbered.
Thanks in advance,
