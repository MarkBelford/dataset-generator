Hi, there
I am interested in facial animation and want to implement some program about this area.
But I don't have any 3 D information for the face.
I am looking for some 3D images of face.
Try getting the Cyberware demo via ftp which contains 3D images of the
face.
What is the copyright status of this data Are there restrictions regarding the
uses they can be put to
