Could anyone direct me to the FTP site where I can find the DOS based
morphing package called DMORF12.ZIP I had downloaded this file last week,
but the new DOS 6 crashed my hard drive and I lost it. Now I can't find the
site where I got it from.
Also, are there any other morphing packages out for DOS freeware or shareware
Thanks in advance,
Barry
