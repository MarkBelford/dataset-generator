The Ballad of David Koresh.
At Concord and at Waco
the tyrant's minions failed.
Though they all died in the fire
Koresh's people have prevailed.
Good irony. The Waco finale was on April 19, Patriot's Day.
On that day 218 years earlier, the militias of Concord, Mass.,
and other nearby towns repelled a gun control raid by the
then current Colonial government .
