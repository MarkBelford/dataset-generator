THE ARMED CITIZEN
Mere presence of a firearm, without a shot being fired, prevents
crime in many instances, as shown by news reports sent to The
Armed Citizen.
Perhaps so, but note that of the accounts cited, there was only
one in which no shot was fired. Of the other twelve, five
described cases in which the assailant was wounded by a shot,
and six described cases in which the assailant was killed by a
shot.
And, had not these citizens accepted the moral responsibility to
protect their own lives, there could well have been at least
13 innocent victims lying dead and several criminals still out
walking the streets perpetrating their crimes on others.
