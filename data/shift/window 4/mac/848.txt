hello out in networld,
We have a lab of old macs SEs and Pluses . We don't have enough money
to buy all new machines, so we are considering buying a few superdrives for
our old macs to allow folks with high density disks to use our equipment.
I was wondering what experiences good or bad people have had with this sort
of upgrade.

Murry,
Why don't you just shell out a couple more dollars and get a floptical.
They can read high density disks 1.4 MB as well as flopticals 21 MB . The
price of flopticals right now range from $300's $400's.
