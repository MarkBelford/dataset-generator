Does anybody know any reliable utils to read english texts with scanner
I want some analysis on quality of recognition, because I want to read
texts which I get by fax you know quality on faxes is rather bad .
The scanner I have is B W and 300dpi. But if there exist any good software
that needs other specifications, that will be OK.
Please, send messages to my E mail or on conference server, I'll summarize
them and consider your recomendations.
THANK YOU
