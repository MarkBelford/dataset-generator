In ,
Does anybody know if there are any good 2d graphics packages
available for IBM RS 6000 AIX I'm looking for something
like DEC's GKS or Hewlett Packards Starbase, both of which
have reasonably good support for different output devices
like plotters, terminals, X etc.
Try graPHIGS from IBM. It is an excellent package :
