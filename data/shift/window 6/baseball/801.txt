Doug Roberts Willing to trade Frank Bolick for a bag of used baseballs
Let's go Expos
One fun note from the Rockies home opener:
I think Frank Bolick's nickname should be Sarge , because whenever we saw his
name in Denver for the Expo series, there was a big E5 next to it.
In the spirit of Chris Berman, how about Frank Cerial Bolick.
Ho Ho Ha Ha
How about,
Frank Jacksonsuck Bolick
Frank Cake Icing Bolick
Frank it's not a cow but a Bolick
Frank How Do you get a ribbon to stay on a birthday present Bolick
Frank Burns Bolick
Frank Lee Bad Player Bolick
Frank I Suck, not Bolick
and so on.
