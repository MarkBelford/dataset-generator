video ' ' Grabber Mac
LLLLLL Board Vision
I know of several NuBus frame grabber boards but wonder if there
might be similar ones for the lesser Macs those without slots ,
something permitting instant freezing of a video picture PAL
and feeding it in without jaggies to a simple digitizer like
MacVision which takes 22 secs to scan a picture, so a frame
grabber is a necessity .
The objective is 512 342 1bit pixel B W pictures stored in
HyperCard. have tried using top quality VCR with freeze frame
function but the screens come out full of streaks and garbage.
PLEASE reply ONLY to
and I'll summarize

group as is c.s.m.h Thanks
