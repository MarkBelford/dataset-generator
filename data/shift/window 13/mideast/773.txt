I consider that defining the belonging to a nation that claims the
right to have a State based on religious belief is a form of racism.
Although I don't want to muddy the waters unnecessarily I disagree. Any
discrimination based on religion is not and cannot be racist unless the
sole qualification for religious membership is racial.
In the same way in which antisemite means anti Jewish and not anti all
persons of who are semite, a form of racism means: A form of segregation
against all those who are different based on the religious identification.
