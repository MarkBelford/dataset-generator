I'm getting ready to buy a multimedia workstation and would like a little
advice. I need a graphics card that will do video in and out under windows.
I was originally thinking of a Targa but that doesn't work under Windows.
What cards should I be looking into
Thanks,
Craig

Craig,
You should still consider the Targa . I run windows 3.1 on it all the
time at work and it works fine. I think all you need is the right
driver.
