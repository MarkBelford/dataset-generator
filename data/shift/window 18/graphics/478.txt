Has anyone got multiverse to work
I have built it on 486 svr4, mips svr4s and Sun SparcStation.
There seems to be many bugs in it. The 'dogfight' and 'dactyl' simply do nothing
After fixing a bug where a variable is defined twice in two different modules One needed
setting to static else the client core dumped

I built it on a rs6000 my only Motif machine works fine. I added some objects
into dogfight so I could get used to flying. This was very easy.
All in all Cool .
