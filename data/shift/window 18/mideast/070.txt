So the wars of 1948, 1956, 1967, 1968 Karama , 1978, and 1982 were
all started by Arabs.
The wars of 1948, 1956, 1967, 1978 were definitely started by the Arabs.
The war in 1982 was instigated by the Arabs who continually murdered
Israeli children with their rocket attacks. Israel was only trying to
stop this.
Last what the heck are you talking about with 1968 Karama There was
no war in 1968
