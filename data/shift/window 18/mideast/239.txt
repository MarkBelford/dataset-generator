As for israelis, Menahim Begal Begin and Yitzhak Shakh Shamir were leaders
Cute, real cute. Now can you please stop being childish and get on
with the issues
of many of these gangs that massacred Palestineans and became the
HEROS of israel and its Prime ministers. Oh sorry I forgot Ben Gurion,
too. I hope he is enjoying his coffin . Now, if israelis donot support
which i doubt the oppression and killing from 1930's now,
You probably mean the mass murders of Jews in the West Bank between 1936 1939.
