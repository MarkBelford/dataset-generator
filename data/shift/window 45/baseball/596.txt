Hey.I've noticed that Luis Alicea is starting at 2nd for the Cardinals
instead of Geronimo Pena. Is Pena hurt, or was he just benched for poor
performance Anyone know
After a quick start, Pena has been stuck in a rut. Torre gave Alicea
the start to try to get Pena out of whatever funk he is in. It has
worked in the past.
