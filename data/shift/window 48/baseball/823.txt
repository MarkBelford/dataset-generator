I am curious to known if there are any professional sports teams whose
games are regularly broadcast on an FM station. The only one I am
aware of is WYSP in Philadelphia who carries the Eagles' games.
If you respond to me I will summarize for the list.
WIP is the REAL home of the Eagles. Merril Reese and the Birds on
FM radio.what a joke.
At least we can hear the joke more than 100 yards outside city limits now.
Will WIP ever strngthen their signal
