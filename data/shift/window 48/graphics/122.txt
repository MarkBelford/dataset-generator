On sunsite.unc.edu in pub multimedia utilities unix find
mpeg play 2.0.tar.Z.
I find for mono it works best as mpeg play dither threshold
though you can use mpeg play dither mono
Face it, this is not be the best viewing situation.
Also someone has made a patch for mpeg play that gives two more mono
modes mono2 and halftone .
They are by Jan Newmarch .
And the patch can be found on csc.canberra.edu.au 137.92.1.1 under
pub motif mpeg2.0.mono.patch.
