Does anyone out there know if there are print drivers for Windows for the
Panasonic KX P1091i 9 pin dot matrix printer
I've been told that Panasonic has uploaded some to Compu$erve, but I
don't have a CIS account. I just use the Epson FX 80 driver myself,
and it comes out very pretty if very slowly on my 1080i.
