having been discusse essentially adnausium the answer is yes.
least for the 600x400 configuration. you can get an adaptor called
Mac
VGA Q from James engineering 510 525 7350 and this will let you
display 600x400 and 800x600 if the monitor is capable. I think the
800x600 requires 56Khz horizontal sync. I use this on my sony 1604.
gives a slightly wider screen than the 832x624 adaptor.
I am using a NEC 4FG with my Centris 610. The cable adapter was provided by
NEC you have to call to get this free adapter . I am also sharing it with my
486 using a switch box and extra cables .
My questions:
How do you tell if it is 600x400 or 800x600 that was displayed
Or how do you change the mode resolution
Is there SW for this or something I have to do with the HW
I am assuming I am getting 800x600 since I have 1M VRAM and the 4FG can display
1028x768 with my 486.
