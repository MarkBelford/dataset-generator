Does anyone know why Apple has an ambiguous message for C650 regarding
fpu In all Mac price lists I've seen, every C650 as the message fpu:
optional . I know from what we've discussed in this newsgroup that all
C650 have the fpu built in except the 4 80 configuration. Why would they
be so unclear about this issue in their price list
Perhaps the reason is simple maybe the marketing people who put together
the brochures and price lists weren't clear on the FPU issue.
Perhaps the marketing people don't KNOW what an FPU is
