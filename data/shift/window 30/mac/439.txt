So far I have only seen pictures of the new ergonomic keyboard,
but it seems that the 'b' is placed on the left part after the split.
However, when I learned typing in school some years ago, I was taught
to write 'b' with my right hand. Is this a difference between Danish
and American typing, or what
Thanks a lot in advance
In germany you usually use the left hand for the 'b'
yours
