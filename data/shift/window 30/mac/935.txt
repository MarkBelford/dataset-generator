My friend recently purchased a LC III and he wants to know if there is
such a demon called NuBus adapter for his PDS slot
The LC family of Macs can only
use PDS cards. They are not able to use NuBus.
Ah, but why Can some technically hip Macslinger tell us what the
difference is between PDS and Nubus
Is it impossible to make a gadget that plugs into PDS and ends in a
Nubus card cage At least, Marvin's friend has not been able to
locate one and neither have I. What is the fundamental reason for
this
I think that there do exist NuBus expansion cages I'm sure I've seen
them advertised occassionally , but I think that the main problem is that
they cost much more than the difference in price between say a LC and IIvx
so unless you need lots of NuBus slots its not worth the bother.
Of course, it may be that these extra boxes are so expensive because
no one buys them because they are so expensive.
NuBus technology isn't a special Apple Proprietry thing I have this
sneaky feeling that it is licensed from Texas Instruments so there
is no problem building an expansion box.
Apple uses the IEEE Nubus 90 standard for their 32 bit backplane bus.
I got this from a technote that I reada couple of weeks ago
Well, almost NuBUS 90 anyway, comprehensive bus contention between processors
is not supported in the current Macintoshes, could be wrong
However, I know for a fact from seeing the Cyclone Data Spec sheets myself,
don't ask, Macintosh Cyclone models will provide full implementation of the
NuBUS standard.
Very interesting possibilities indeed
