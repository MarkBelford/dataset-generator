It's worth noting that US vs. Miller sustained Miller's conviction
of possession of an illegal firearm, noting that a sawed off shotgun
was not a proper militia weapon. Therefore, US vs. Miller supports
limited government regulation of firearms.
Then it also supports basing such regulations on ignorance.
Miller had disappeared, and nobody bothered to present his
side to the Supreme Court in particular, that sawed off
shotguns were used in the World War I trenches, and in other
tight spots ever since guns had been invented. Would you
turn one down if you had to clean an alley in E. St. Louis
