Now that Big Brother has rubbed out one minority religion in Waco, who is
next The Mormons or Jews
The Koreshians rubbed themselves out. Neither Mormons nor Jews have a
propensity for dousing themselves with kerosene, so I'm not particularly
concerned. Or shall we blame Jim Jones on the government also
I believe we still remember Masada, where Jews killed themselves rather
than being captured by the Romans. While I do not agree with the
Davidians, I must admire their willingness to die for what they
believed, which Jews have had to do often.
