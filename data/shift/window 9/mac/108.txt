What is the difference
I want a double spin CD ROM drive by May
looking into NEC and Apple, doublespins only
what is the best
Nec Toshiba and Sony Apple nearly deliver the same speed.
As apples prices are very low compared to there RAM SIMMS
You should buy what is inexpencive. But think of Driver revisions.
It is easier to get driver kits from Apple than from every other
manufacturer

I thought NEC and Toshiba CD ROM mechanism have an average
access time of less than 200 ms. While the SONY APPLE CD ROM
drive has an access time of 300 ms for the doublespin models.

The Toshiba has a 200ms access time, the NEC has a 280ms access
time, right around the Sony Apple. Access time is, of course,
somewhat important, but not as vital in the case of CDs as data
transfer rate.
All the drives are double speed drives with maximum data transfer
rates of 300K second. Any is a good choice. Apple's is very cheap
when included with new Macs and I agree with Christian's comment
about drivers.
Plus, Apple's is bootable on the Centris and Quadra 800. A very nice
feature if you need to install System software. I don't know if the
NEC or Toshiba are bootable on those machines.
