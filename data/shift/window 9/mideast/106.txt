One of my biggest complaints about using the word fundamentalist
is that at least in the U.S.A. people speak of muslime
fundamentalists muslim
but nobody defines what a jewish or christan fundamentalist is.
I wonder what an equal definition would be.
any takers.
Well, I would go as far as saying that Naturei Karta are definitely
Jewish fundamentalists. Other ultra orthodox Jewish groups might very
well be, though I am hesitant of making such a broad generalization.
