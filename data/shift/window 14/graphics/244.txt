I have the ATI GRAPHICS ULTRA PRO EISA version. I must admit it has
received bad press but that was due to the faulty drivers it had.
PC Magazine seems to be impressed with the ATI card in their most recent
reviews. In the April 13th issue they rate the ATI Graphics Ultra Pro
EISA version as their Editor's Choice . They noted that the drivers
had improved since they tested the ISA version in January.

Yeah they also gave it their Editor's Choice in the run down of
graphics accelerators they tested in the previous issue, which is why
I bought and then returned mine. The only conclusion I can come up with
is that PC Magazine has wildly different ways on determining the worthiness
of a video card than I do.
