Does anyone know how to open up the Apple Ergo Mouse ADB Mouse II Mine
lives near a cat true, really. and picks up her fur. From what I can tell,
it looks like Apple welded it shut.
By rotating the plate around the mouse ball counter clockwise you can open
the mouse and clean it. It isn't as obvious as the Desktop Bus Mouse I but
it opens quite easily once you see what has to be done.
