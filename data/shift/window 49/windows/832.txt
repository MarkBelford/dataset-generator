Has anyone experienced a faint shadow at all resolutions using this
card. Is only in Windows. I have replaced card and am waiting on
latest drivers. Also have experienced General Protection Fault Errors
in WSPDPSF.DRV on Winword Tools Option menu and in WINFAX setup.
I had the exact same failure with the 24X and Word for Windows.
A quick call to Microsoft indicated it was problem with the
24X drivers. You need to call Diamond and get the new drivers,
I think version 2.03 fixes the above problem, there may be later
versions that I'm unaware of.
Version 2.03 drivers are current.
