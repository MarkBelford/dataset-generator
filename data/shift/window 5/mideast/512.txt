ALL Jews suffered during WWII, not just our beloved who perished or were
tortured. We ALL suffered.
All humans suffered emotionally, some Jews and many
others suffered physically.
I'm just waiting for Andi to tell us that African Americans should
start paying compensation to White Americans who suffered from being
slave owners.
Do you have a problem with the language I said
everyone suffered emotionally because they sympathyzed with the
victims of Holocaust. I wasn't implying that anyone suffered
more than the actual victims. Neither was I implying any
wrongdoing on the part of the Jews as the cause for the
Holocaust. What is wrong with you guys Regardless of what one
says you keep hearing what you want to hear.
