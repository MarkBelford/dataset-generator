I would really like to get one of the new CD300i CDROM
drives for my c650, but my local Apple doesn't know
when they will be available. He doesn't even have a part
number yet. Does anyone know what the part number
for this drive is and when it will be available
My Apple dealer suggested I buy one of the CD300 external
drives, but I don't want to pay extra for a case power supply
I'm not going to use.

The CD300 external is already shipping and has been shipping for quite awhile
now. Demand for the units are high, so they are pretty rare. I've seen them
listed for around $525 550 at local computer stores and the campus Mac
reseller. I've also heard rumors that they are bundled with a couple of CD's,
but I can't confirm it.
