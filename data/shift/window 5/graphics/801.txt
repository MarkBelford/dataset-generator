Hi,
I'm looking for a program which is able to display 24 bits
images. We are using a Sun Sparc equipped with Parallax
graphics board running X11.
xli, xloadimage or ImageMagick export.lcs.mit.edu 18.24.0.12 contrib
xv 3.0 shareware supports 24 bit displays, and has lots of other
improvements over earlier versions. Definitely worth checking out
also at export
Jean.
