Could somebody let me know of a drawing utility that can be
used to manipulate postscript files.I am specifically interested in
drawing lines, boxes and the sort on Postscript contour plots.
I have tried xfig and I am impressed by it's features. However
it is of no use since I cannot use postscript files as input for the
programme.Is there a utility that converts postscript to xfig format
Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Have you checked out Adobe Illustrator There are a few Unix versions
for it available, depending on your platform. I know of two Unix versions:
One for Mach NeXT and for Irix SGI . There may be others, such
as for Sun SparcStation, but I don't know for sure.
