In a previous article, JASON WALTER WORKS says:
The N.Y.Yankees, are now one game closer to the A.L.East pennant. They
clobbered Cleveland, 9 1, on a fine pitching performance by Key, and two
homeruns by Tartabull first M.L.baseball to go out this season , and a three
run homer by Nokes. For all of you who didn't pick Boggs in your pools,
tough break, he had a couple hits, and drove in a couple runs with many more
to follow . The Yanks beat an up and coming team of youngsters in the
Indians. The Yankees only need to win 95 more games to get the division.
GO YANKS., Mattingly for g.glove, and MVP, and Abbot for Cy Young.

Please spare us. And check you facts before you post
