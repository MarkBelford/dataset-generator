The defenition of the Underdog is a team that has no talent and comes
out of nowhere to contend. The '69 Mets and '89 Orioles are prime examples,
not the Cubs.
Sorry, but it is virtually impossible to win a division with no talent
over 162 games.
Well, with players, certainly. However, it is quite possible to win
it all with no managerial talent. Cf. Blue Jays, 1992.
