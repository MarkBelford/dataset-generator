I have not made up my mind about Waco, but there sure seems to be a group
devoted government following fanatics willing to believe whatever that
government wants to tell them, without any shred of doubt, nor thought of
thier
own. They sure get shrill whenever their belief structure is being shaken.
Kinda reminds you of the BDs, doesn't it

You have a way with words. And you sure get shrill on cue.

I'm always rethinking that. There's never been a day when I haven't rethought
