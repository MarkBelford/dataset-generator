I was hoping that however the situation was resolved the
property would remain intact, so the gov't could sell it to help pay for the
hundreds of thousands of dollars of expenses incurred having to babysit
Krazy Koresh his flock of sheep.
In some South American countries, after political undesirables disappeared,
the family would get a notice of death and a bill for the disposal
of the body. You apparently think that would be a good idea.
The Federal Government initiated this action against Koresh and his
followers, surrounded them for 51 days, engaged in psychological
warfare, used heavy military equipment against US citizens on
US soil and now that the compound caught fire while they were
pumping in CS gas after knocking holes in the building disavows
all responsibility. Big Brother is NOT always right.
