What is a CCW
Acronym for Concealed Carrying of Weapon basically, a permit to carry
a concealed pistol or revolver.
I phoned Licensing Division in Washington State to ask for an application
for a CCW. Instead they promptly sent me an applicationfor becoming a
firearms dealer in Washington
They even sent me a firearms safety pamphlet.
