Your view of this entire matter is far too serenely one sided and
selectively naive.
Oooh. now THAT hurts. I will not suffer you through more naive
and one sided views of mine. Please skip my articles in the future
Oh Wise Tim, and have a good day.

What is the point in throwing out one sided viewpoints which means:
ignoring that the other side's perspective and experience HAS ANY
LEGITIMACY while assuming that your side possesses no faults and
bears no responbility for ANY of the negative impacts of a particular
event Isn't the former onesided Isn't the latter naive If you feel
that my opinion is wrong then please tell me how. Strategic withdrawal
under the cover of a snide remark seems to be the favored tactic on this
net but doesn't accomplish anything.
