Eh Could you please give me details about an event where a Neutral
Observer was killed by purpose by an Israeli soldier
There are many cases, but I do not remeber names. The Isralis shot and killed
a UN observer in Gaza in the first half of Intifada.
Not exactly the same, but reminiscent of the assassination of Count
Bernadotte, who was the UN negotiator during the 1948 Israeli war of
independence. He was killed by the Israelis. Seems he was being too
successful in negotiating a cease fire, which would have worked
territorially against the nascent Israel, compared to continued war.
