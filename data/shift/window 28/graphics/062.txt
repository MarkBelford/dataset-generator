I've been trying to view .tga files created in POVRAY. I have the Diamond
SpeedStar 24 Video board not the 24X . So far I can convert them to
jpeg using cjpeg and view them with CVIEW but that only displays 8 bit color.
I'm looking for some way to convert and or view them in 24 bit.
I have UNIVESA uvesa31.zip and the DVPEG viewer but I don't get anything.
Perhaps I am not setting up UNIVESA properly If anyone has ideas about this
please feel free to enlighten me.
Just want to see the darn things in real color.
Image Alchemy aka alchemy will view the TGA files that POV outputs
and just about any other format you can think of. It will also convert
between all these. It's shareware, so it's probably available by FTP
somwhere out there in netland.
Yep. Alchemy works fine on my Tseng400 DAC, but I think I remember
reading that it only displays in 15 bit or so. Of course, that's still 32K
colors which is nothing to sneeze at. Use the v flag.
