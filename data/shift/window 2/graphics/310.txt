Could anyone tell me if it's possible to save each frame
of a .gl grasp animation to .gif, .jpg, .iff or any other
picture formats.
If you have the GRASP animation system, then yes, it's quite easy.
You simply use GLIB to extract the image each frame in a .GL is
actually a complete .PCX or .CLP file , then use one of MANY available
utilities to convert it. If you don't have the GRASP package, I'm afraid
I can't help you. Sorry.
By the way, before you ask, GRASP GRaphics Animation System for
Professionals is a commercial product that sells for just over US$300
from most mail order companies I've seen. And no, I don't have it. :
