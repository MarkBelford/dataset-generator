I am currently looking for a 3D graphics library that runs on MS
Windows 3.1. Are there any such libraries out there other than
Visuallib It must run on VGA and should not require any other
add on graphics cards .
For Visuallib, will it run with Metaware High C compiler v3.0 Any
email contact for the author of Visuallib
Any help would be much appreciated. Thanks.
