This is my first time on the network, but I am very concerned with this
incident in Waco. I will refrain from stating my opinions until after I have
read the FAQ. Could someone tell me how to get this I must say that I
believe the Govt. was wrong in the actions that they took in this situation.
As far as I know, there is no FAQ for tpg. Somebody was working
on one, but I think it died in committee.
