I've tried compiling it on several SPARCstations with gcc 2.22. After
fixing up a few bugs 3 missing constant definitions plus a couple of
other things I got it to compile link, but after starting client
server I just get a black window sometimes the client core dumps,
sometimes the server, sometimes I get a broken pipe, sometimes it
just sits there doing nothing although I occassionally get the
cursor to become a cross hair in dog fight, but that's it. I've
sent word to the author plus what I did to fix it last week, but
no reply as yet.

I've discovered a bug in the libraries parser parser.c loadcolour function where it was generating a segmentation fault. It appears the colourList is geting corrupted somehow. I had it return random colours instead and everything worked great except for a few colour problems so I know its the only thing wrong.
The colour table somehow gets a couple of nulls placed in it so when the name of the colours are compared it crashes. I haven't found the problem yet maybe someone else can.
