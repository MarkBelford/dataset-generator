Two of the nine who escaped the compound said the fire was deliberately set
by cult members.
Correction: The FBI says that two of the nine who escaped said the fire
was deliberately set by cult members. Since the press was kept miles away,
we have absolutely no independent verification of any of the government's
claims in this matter.
Indeed. Larry King had the two attorneys whose clients are now
dead of Koresh and another Davidian on his show last night. Their
discussions with the survivors differ from the FBI account. The
attorneys say that they were told that the tanks knocked over lanterns
in the compound which started the fires.
Government spokespeople have lied and contradicted each other
throughout this whole affair. I'll wait for some better evidence before
I form an opinion.
