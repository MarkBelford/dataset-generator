Anybody got Arlen Spectre's address I want to write to him and thank him
for showing the leadership to demand a Congressional investigation
into the Waco mess.

You are talking about the man who as a federal attorney did so
much to frustrate the proper investigation of the JFK assassination by
the House sub committee on assassinations. Fox and hen house
Please note that my above comment was not intended as a flame of Ken's
call for Congressional leadership to conduct a proper investigation.
It was merely to call attention to the hazard of having Specter involved.
If anyone took it that way, I apologize.
Joe Gaut In the super state, it really does not
matter at all what actually happened.
Remember the Alamo Truth is what the government chooses to
Remember Waco tell you. Justice is what it wants to happen.
