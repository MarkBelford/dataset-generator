If it takes making it an alt group, then why not I've been following
this thread for, what has it been, two months now
The alt. hierarchie is created for 2 purposes:
1. For groups which do not fit under the comp. or other 'official'
hierarchies
2. For the fast creation of hot new newsgroups like alt.gulf.war
Because there is no voting process or any other control facilities,
sites are free to decide not to carry some of the alt groups.
Therefore, it is I think desirable to try to create comp.graphics.
raytrace, rendering or whatever and not an alt group
