My friend recently purchased a LC III and he wants to know if there is
such a demon called NuBus adapter for his PDS slot
The LC family of Macs can only
use PDS cards. They are not able to use NuBus.
Ah, but why Can some technically hip Macslinger tell us what the
difference is between PDS and Nubus
Is it impossible to make a gadget that plugs into PDS and ends in a
Nubus card cage At least, Marvin's friend has not been able to
locate one and neither have I. What is the fundamental reason for
this
