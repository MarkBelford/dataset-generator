Saw a REAL interesting report on CNN last night it seems the gas that
was used has been banned by international law for military use. However,
our president was quick to point out that there are exemptions for law
enforcement . Hmmm. too inhumane to use in war against the enemy,
but OK for civilians
Whoa. Think twice, now, unless you want the same standards applied to
hollowpoints.
