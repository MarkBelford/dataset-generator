re a true 24 bit XV
If you would come up with a solid, logical, well argued and lucid description of
precisely how these proposed extensions would work, feel free to post them
Don't mind if I do.
As someone who would love to see XV go to 24 bit, this
would be plenty for me.
a XV can Load a 24 bit image, and display it in all it's
24 bit glory on 24 bit X displays.
b All other operations Crop, Dither, Smooth, etc. are not
supported on 24 bit images.
how hard would this be
