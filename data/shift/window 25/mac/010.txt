To my knowledge there is no way to fully discharge a Duo battery.
The program PowerStrip2.0, which is freeware, has an option called
Quick Discharge. You can find it on the Mac archives, probably
sumex aim.stanford.edu or mac.archive.umich.edu.
Good luck

Is it a hidden option I'm using PowerStrip 2.0 by Mr. Caputo right now
and can't find any quick discharge option. It definitely is on
mac.archive.umich.edu 'cause I submitted it
