Anybody got Arlen Spectre's address I want to write to him and thank him
for showing the leadership to demand a Congressional investigation
into the Waco mess.
If I had Arlen's address, I would go to his house Do weasels live
in houses or in holes and personally tell him what a pathetic idiot
he is. Arlen is the personification of the word jerk . snip.
I'm no fan of Arlen Spectre's, but he did the right thing, and attacking his
motives in this case is wrong.
Pardon me, here, but I don't trust Spectre's motives here at all. Spectre
was a major part of the Warren Commission, remember the magic bullet theory
and is NOT to be trusted if there's even the tiniest chance the guv'mint may
have done something wrong. If he gets a chance I'm afraid he will satisfy
the public outcry with another whitewash.
Unfortunately, if some of us get our wish and the BATF is disbanded or folded
into the FBI, etc., we may end up with a more efficient agency than the
bumbling and competition we have today. Some agents should be fired. Some
should be prosecuted. But keep them as bumbling as possible we retain more
of our liberties that way.
Right on the money here. We should certainly applaud the disbanding of the
BARTF but we must stress the personal responsibility of the goons who set
up the assault on American citizens.
We must NOT count on Spectre, though, to get it done.
