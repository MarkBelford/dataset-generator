Hi there,
when I run Disk First Aid on my external hard drive Quantum LPS 240 I get the followinf
message: Error 535: Missing thread record TarID 31015 TarBlock 416
Disk First Aid is not able to fix this problem, Norton Utils doesn't find it at all.
When I use Norton Disk editor to look at TarBlock 416 I can read something like DirReservedArea
My question: How can I get rid of this error without reformatting of course
