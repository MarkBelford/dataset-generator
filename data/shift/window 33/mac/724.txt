How do I get a subscription to MacWeek. I want one, but I don't seem to be able
to find a subscription card anywhere.
email
I just ordered my subscription today. Call MacWeek's Customer Service
Dept. at 609 461 2100 and quote some plastic. If you forget the number,
it's included in the statement of ownership, which is on the contents
page of the copy I have. A one year subscription costs $99.00 in the U.S,
Canada, or Mexico. I was told my first issue would arrive in 4 6 weeks.
