From article , by Paul H. Pimentel :
What gives Isreal the right to keep Jeruseleum It is the home of the muslim a
s well as jewish religion, among others. Heck, nobody ever mentions what Yitza
k Shamir did forty or fifty years ago which is terrorize westerners much in the
way Abdul Nidal does today. Seems Isrealis are nowhere above Arabs, so theref
ore they have a right to Jerusaleum as much as Isreal does.
There is one big difference between Israel and the Arabs, Christians in this
respect.
Israel allows freedom of religion.
Avi.
Avi,
For your information, Islam permits freedom of religion there is
no compulsion in religion. Does Judaism permit freedom of religion
i.e. are non Jews recognized in Judaism . Just wondering.
