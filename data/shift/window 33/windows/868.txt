An earlier article in this newsgroup made reference to
WinQVT Net version 3.4. Realy Where I tried archie
with no luck. It's probably just a typo.
Not a typo. It was uploaded to ftp.cica.indiana.edu a couple days back.
But I sure would like to get one if it's real as I too
have a printer problem in WinQVT.
Version 3.4 uses standard Windows printer drivers.

It's still in the pub pc win3 uploads directory as qvtnet34.zip.
