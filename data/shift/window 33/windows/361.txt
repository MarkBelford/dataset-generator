Excuse me Are you one of those people who enjoy working w win Come talk
to a house mate of mine and tell him how productive his life is when he
encountered yet another sudden appearence of the DOS prompt while cutting
and pasting in win Or an empty win screen without any tasks running i.e.
ESC brings up an empty list, progman has done it again.
Sigh
Don't know what your roomate is doing but it must be something wrong.
Are there people who enjoy using Windows Yes. I'll admit to it. Given
a choice between a Mac and Windows I choose Windows every time to
start another flame thread 9 .
