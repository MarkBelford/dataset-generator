Can anyone tell me if and how they have printed Spanish characters I know WP 5.1 has this built in, but I do not recall ever seeing this option on WFW2. HELP
Try using the extended character set Alt sequences . .
look in Character Map in the Accessories group and see the alt sequence
for the font you want
