Note that Bo Gritz was on the Populist party ticket with David
Duke for veep in 1988 until he found out that Duke was leading
he ticket, when he withdrew his candidacy.
That's a revisionist account of what happened. Gritz was well aware
of Duke's presence on the ticket. Given that Gritz is not at all shy
about associating and promoting other white supremacists such as the
Christian Identity movement or Willis Carto , whatever reasons Gritz
had to leave the ticket had nothing to do with Duke's presence.
So Gritz gave up his
chance to be Vice President of the US just to aviod supporting
Duke.
I'd hardly call that giving up his chance to be Vice President of the US
the chance of the Populist Party ticket winning is essentially nil. Still,
it does imply that he doesn't want to be associated with Duke.
I believe Chip Berlet has a Populist Party newsletter from the time with
a photo of Gritz happily shaking hands with Duke.
