Does anyone know if a digitized version of the GeoSphere image is
available via ftp For those of you who don't know, it is a composite
photograph of the entire earth, with cloudcover removed. I just think
it's really cool. It was created with government funds and sattelites
as a research project, so I would assume it's in the public domain.
Thanks for any info,
Ryan
