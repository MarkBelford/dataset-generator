Oh, then, I guess that shooting THOSE kind of babies is all right.
You sick bastard.
If you believe that I speak for my company,
OR write today for my special Investors' Packet.
Why thanks for your reply to my post. By the way, I never, never ever said
that it was right to shoot THOSE kind of babies. However it was the Branch
Davidian people in there that insisted on staying there with their savior
yeah right budy boy because he had brain washed them into believing that
what ever he says is the truth, even if means that they are to give up their
lives for HIS cause. Therefore it is Davids fault and not the ATF's
who gave them 50 to 51 days to get out, this was 50 days to many for me and
for many of the rest of the U.S. I am however sad to hear of the death of any
child unlike the sick bastard I supposedly am.
