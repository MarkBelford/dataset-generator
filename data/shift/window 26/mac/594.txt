Is there a fix for this We have a Quadra 900 that will NOT finish startup
unless there is a monitor connected. This would be no problem, but since
we're running it as a file server, there is no need to have a monitor
connected all the time.
I've seen a control panel made for this. I don't remember the name, where I
saw it, or on what Quadra models it will work. But I do know it exists :

I will poke around in the U of M archives and see if I find something. If
anyone else finds this, please post the location :
