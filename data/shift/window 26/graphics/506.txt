Hi, I'm just getting into PoVRay and I was wondering if there is a graphic
package that outputs .POV files. Any help would be appreciated.
Thanks.
A very good modeling package I found is irit' look for irit.tar.Z .
However there is no converter from it's format to POV format. I postet
a request for such a converter in this group but got no response,
so I'm considering to write such a program myself.
