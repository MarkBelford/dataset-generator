From article , by Paul H. Pimentel :
There is one big difference between Israel and the Arabs, Christians in this
respect.
Israel allows freedom of religion.
Avi,
For your information, Islam permits freedom of religion there is
no compulsion in religion. Does Judaism permit freedom of religion
i.e. are non Jews recognized in Judaism . Just wondering.
In Islam, there is no compulsion, just a tax on dhimini. In
Judaism, non Jews are allowed to do as they wish, and there is no
effort made to convert them.

If we had a budget big enough for drugs and sexual favors, we sure
wouldn't waste them on members of Congress. John Perry Barlow
