If indeed Israeli soldiers killed a Hamas Mujahid with an anti tank missile
then I'm almost sure that the terrorist zionists would not have been able
to cut up a body which was probably desintegrated by the missile.
maybe the missile didn't hit directly such that his body
gets desintegrated. of course, destroying 10 houses to
kill someone is not a surgical operation, or is it
