The following is quoted from the tail end of a rather condescending
article about Paxton Quigley, that appeared in US Snooze and World Lies,
sorry. i think it was in the wall street journal.
and was repeated in the Colorado people's Daily, a student newspaper
at the University of Colorado at Boulder.
A study of residential gunsot deaths in King County, Wash., found that
a gun in the home was 43 times more likely to be used to kill its owner,
spouse, a friend, or child than to kill an intruder. Studies by the
Western Psychiatric Institute, in Pittsburgh, found that the mere presence
of a gun in the home sharply incresases the likelihood a family member
will commit suicide, even in the absence of psychiatric illness.
I have seen these numbers quoted before, and I have seen very specific
refutation of them quoted as well. If someone will be so kind as to
email the relevant information, I will write a letter to the editor of
the Co. Daily which might get published and send a copy to USN WR as
well.
Thanx.
