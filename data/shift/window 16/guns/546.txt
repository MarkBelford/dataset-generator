Good question. Take an objective look at what happened, listen to the
things that the FBI said The BD's started the fire. The BD's bodies
were found with gunshot wounds. that are now being refuted by the
evidence being recovered. Seems that the FBI is deliberately making
statements that have no rational basis in fact, and trying to make
them sound like fact.
That's another sad thing. I'd expect this sort of shit from the BATF.
But I'm goddamn disappointed in the FBI. They used to be professionals.
