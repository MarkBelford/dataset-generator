What a piece of work is man how noble in reason how infinite in faculties
in form and moving, how express and admirable in action how like an angel
in apprehension how like a god the beauty of the world, the paragon of
animals And yet to me what is the quintessence if dust
Man delights not me.
Shakespeare, Hamlet
