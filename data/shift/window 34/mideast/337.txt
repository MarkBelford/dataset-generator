From Israel Line, Thursday, April 22, 1993:
Today's HA'ARETZ reports that three women were injured when a
Katyusha rocket fell in the center of their community. The rocket
was one of several dozen fired at the communities of the Galilee in
northern Israel yesterday by the terrorist Hizbullah organization .

Congratulations to the brave men of the Lebanese resistance With every
Israeli son that you place in the grave you are underlining the moral
bankruptcy of Israel's occupation and drawing attention to the Israeli
government's policy of reckless disregard for civilian life.
Apparently, the Hizbollah were encouraged by Brad's cheers
good job, Brad . Someone forgot to tell them, though, that
Brad asks them to place only Israeli sons in the grave,
not daughters. Paraphrasing a bit, with every rocket that
the Hizbollah fires on the Galilee, they justify Israel's
holding to the security zone.
