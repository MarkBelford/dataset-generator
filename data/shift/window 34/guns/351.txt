Now that Big Brother has rubbed out one minority religion in Waco, who is
next The Mormons or Jews
The Koreshians rubbed themselves out. Neither Mormons nor Jews have a
propensity for dousing themselves with kerosene, so I'm not particularly
concerned. Or shall we blame Jim Jones on the government also
Let's see if I have this straight. A law is created that says you can not
have a automatic weapon and therefore it's ok for the government to use
any level of force to enforce that law. Doesn't matter if the entire
population of the planet is destroyed as long as that law is obeyed.
Do I read you correctly
