Does anyone know if a digitized version of the GeoSphere image is
available via ftp For those of you who don't know, it is a composite
photograph of the entire earth, with cloudcover removed. I just think
it's really cool. It was created with government funds and sattelites
as a research project, so I would assume it's in the public domain.
This image is copyrighted. Early in another news group it was being
used as a texture map in a planet orbiting simulation. That program
was being freely distributed but the texture map picture for the
earth had to be pulled because of copyright infringement issues.
