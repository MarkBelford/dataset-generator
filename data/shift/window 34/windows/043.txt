We are using pkzip V2.04 and I am interested to hear from
people who have used one of the many Windows programs that
call these.
Is there a full windows version that does not call the DOS
PKZIP PKUNZIP commands

There is WunArchive, the replacement of WunZip. It only extracts, but it
ssupports pkzip 2.04. It does NOT require pkz unzip in order to work, and
ccosts only $10 to register.
