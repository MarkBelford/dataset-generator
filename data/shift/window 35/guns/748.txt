I only caught about the last 15 minutes of this show I hope to see it
when it repeats later , but did manage to catch the summary.
According to Koresh's lawyer and some other guy who I am not sure who he
is , The Davidians DID NOT start the fire and apparently made several
attempts at escaping but were blocked by smoke, fire, and FBI tanks.
He states this after interviews with thoses 9 Davidians that escaped.
They indicated that their was no suicide pact and that the fire was set by
the FBI I got that impression, not sure about that .
Something about this whole mess just doesn't smell right. It didn't Feb.
28th and is doesn't now.
