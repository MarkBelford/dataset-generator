If the FBI started the fire, why didn t people flee the
burning building
Could be a lot of reasons, James. We won't know until the survivors are
allowed to speak for themselves, rather than through an FBI spokesman.
Some of the survivors have been interviewed on TV as they were going
to or returning from court. They basically said, no way was there any
kind of suicide pact or attempt.
Remember the Texas holocaust.
