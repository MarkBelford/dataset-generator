The RISC means reduced instruction set computer . The RISC usually has
small instruction set so as to reduce the circuit complex and can increase
the clock rate to have a high performance. You can read some books about
computer architecture for more information about RISC.
hmm. not that I am an authority on RISC but I clearly remember
reading that the instruction set on RISC CPUs is rather large.
The difference is in addressing modes RISC instruction sets are not
as orthogonal is CISC.
There are some things you might be interested to know about today's RISC
processors. It is true that there are fewer instructions, but what is
not commonly known is that this causes the size of your executables to
swell, so that in some cases performance is similar for larger applications.
As a compromise, many RISC processors today are actually a cross between
a Reduced Instructions Set, and a Complex one.
This is not to say that there is no future in CISC processors, Intel has
certainly proved that.
What I want to know, is what does this have to do with this group

Some people say it's fun, but I think it's very serious.
