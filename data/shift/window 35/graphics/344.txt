Does anyone have any other suggestions where the 42 came from
I don't know where Douglas Adams took it from, but I'm pretty sure he's
the one who launched it in the Guide . Since then it's been showing up
all over the place.
Douglas Adams once said paraphrased from memory : I just picked it. It
seemed like the sort of number you wouldn't be afraid to take home to meet
your parents. Nice and even, perfectly normal.
