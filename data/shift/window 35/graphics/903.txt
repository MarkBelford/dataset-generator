Hi Everyone :
I was woundering if someone could answer a simple
query for me on RayTracing and anti aliasing .
stuff deleted
I have a similiar question relating to anti alaising that my friend has asked
to have posted to the more knowledgable in this group. I'm sorry if this is
an FAQ.
What anti alaising methods do Persistance Of Vision Polyray use
Thank you in advance. You can either email me or reply or flame me if it is
an FAQ :
