I said:
Besides, there's no case that can be made for US military involvement
there that doesn't apply equally well to, say, Liberia, Angola, or
it appears with the Khmer Rouge's new campaign Cambodia. Non whites
don't count
Hmm.some might say Kuwaitis are non white. Ooops, I forgot, Kuwaitis are
oil rich , loaded with petro dollars , etc so they don't count.
and let's not forget Somalia, which is about as far from white as it
gets.
Not according to reports I have read. It seems that the Somalis think
of our African American Marines in less than complimentary terms, using
gestures that signify a word I refuse to use. Seems that even when you
try to help people, they still insult you.
That's two in a row, care to try for more
