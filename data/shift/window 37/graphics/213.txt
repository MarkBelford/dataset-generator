Sorry, Bryan, this is not quite correct. Remember the VGALIB package that comes
with Linux SLS It will switch to VGA 320x200x256 mode without Xwindows.
So at least it is possible to write a GIF viewer under Linux. However I don't
think that there exists a similar SVGA package, and viewing GIFs in 320x200 is
not very nice.
No, VGALIB Amazing. I guess it was lost in all those subdirs :
Thanks for correcting me. It doesn't sound very appealing though, only
320x200 I'm glad it wasn't something major I missed.
Thanks,
