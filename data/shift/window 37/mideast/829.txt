Why is it, then, that when the British, Iranians and UAE refer to
Occupied Territory, they mean territory in dispute in Israel but not
in their own affairs
I suppose for the same reason Jews call the Occupied Territory, Judea and
Sumaria. It's called propaganda and if you repeat lies often enough,
people start to believe it.
