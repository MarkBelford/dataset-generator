In a previous article, Tim Clock says:
Since one is also unlikely to get the truth from either Arab or
Palestinian news outlets, where do we go to understand , to learn
Is one form of propoganda more reliable than another
There are many neutral human rights organizations which always report
on the situation in the O.T.
A neutral organization would report on the situation in
Israel, where the elderly and children are the victims of stabbings by
Hamas activists. A neutral organization might also report that
Israeli arabs have full civil rights.
The Israelis used to arrest and sometimes to kill some of these
neutral reporters.
Care to name names, or is this yet another unsubstantiated
slander
So, this is another kind of terrorism committed by the Jews in Palestine.
They do not allow fair and neutral coverage of the situation in Palestine.
Terrorism, as you would know if you had a spine that allowed
you to stand up, is random attacks on civilians. Terorism includes
such things as shooting a cripple and thowing him off the side of a
boat because he happens to be Jewish. Not allowing people to go where
they are likely to be stabbed and killed, like a certain lawyer killed
last week, is not terorism.
