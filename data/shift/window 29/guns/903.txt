In article you write:
Which Article of the Constitution gives me the right of revolution if things
seem to be going cockeyed
Hmmm.

Dunno if you'll find it in the Constitution, but that other document of American
liberty, that kids are taught to hallow in school, is the Declaration of
Independence. That document is in fact a justification not just for the right
if revolution, but of the DUTY of revolution by the people, once the government
gets too oppressive. It is a very radical document, and I recommend all
Americans. especially those in office. read it once a year.
