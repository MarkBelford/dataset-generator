I called the Texas bill tracking people 800 253 9693 again today
regarding HB 1776 Concealed Carry. Well, it was supposed to come
up for a vote this past Wednesday, but the bill got sent back to
the Public Safety Committee. The PSC gave it a favorable rating
AGAIN, and the bill must now be scheduled for debate by
the Calendars Committee AGAIN.
