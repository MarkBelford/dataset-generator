deaths by handguns alone FBI statistics . In the same year, the UK
suffered 35 such deaths Scotland Yard statistics . The population
of the UK is about 1 5 that of the US 10,000 35 5 . Weighted
for population, the US has 57x as many handgun related deaths as the
UK. And, no, the Brits don't make up for this by murdering 57x as
many people with baseball bats.

yourself.
