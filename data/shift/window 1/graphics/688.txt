I saw an imaging program some time ago on an Amiga that had
Cross, Sobel and Roberts filters for edge detection.
Can anybody direct me to these algorithms.
OK, never heard of Cross filters, but Roberts, Prewitt and Sobel filters
are standard spatial masks for edge detection. Highpass filtering does a
good job of detecting edges, too. A good reference for all sorts of general
digital image processing is the book Digital Image Processing by
Rafael C. Gonzalez and Richard E. Woods. Addison Wesley Publishing Co. 1992.

I've used this source to do the above filters and many other things as a
grad project. Not too dificult to do. The worst part is loading in the
images from TIFF GIF IFF ILBM whatever :
