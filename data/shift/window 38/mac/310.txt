If you have no friends, buy a 128 MB optical
Huh If I buy a 128M optical, I might lose my friends Why do they
smell bad
and stop worrying about cartridge wear Bernoulli or crashes SyQuest
On a serious note, I have heard the tales about SyQuest failures. But I
am curious about Jon's comments on cartridge wear for the the Bernoullis.
Can someone elaborate Is there a general consensus that the 128M opticals

opposed to drive mechanism failures.
