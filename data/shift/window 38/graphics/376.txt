but I'm looking for a fast polygon routine to be used in a 3D game.
A fast polygon routine to do WHAT
To draw polygons of course. Its a VGA mode 13h 320x200 game, .
Hi, I've come across a fast triangle fill draw routine for mode 13h. By
calling this routine enough times, you have a fast polygon drawing routine.
I think I ftp'ed from wuarchive.wustl.edu: pub MSDOS UPLOADS programming.
I have a copy of it so I reupload it there. The triangle.txt file has this
to say :
C and inline assembly source for a VGA mode 13h triangle drawer.
