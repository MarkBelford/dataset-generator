Thank you for remembering Matzada. Matzada was not an insane act. It was
a sanctification of G D's name and the most extreme denial of tyranny
possible. To this day the officers of the Tzahal Isreal Defense Force
take their oath at the fortress. Lo Tepol Shaynit Matzadah. Matzadah will
not fall again
Not anymore Recent archaeological inspection of the site presents pretty
compelling evidence that the mass suicide at Masada never occured. This
evidence was so compelling tha the Tzahal no long hold their secret ceremony
at the fortress.
