None of this changes the fact that MSW3.1 is objectively inferior to its
competition.
Do you mean that MSW3.1 is objectively inferior in some respects which
is trivially true , that it is objectively inferior in all respecets
which is trivially false or do you mean something else What criteria
have you chosen for your objective assesment Are you sure that these
criteria are themselves objective
I have begun to learn in life that the masses never choose the best option
available to them they choose the one which they have been conditioned to
think is best. I'm glad I'm not one of them.
