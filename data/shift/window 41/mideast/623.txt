04 16 93 1045 ARMENIA SAYS IT COULD SHOOT DOWN TURKISH PLANES
Ermenistan kasiniyor.
Let me translate for everyone else before the public traslation service gets
into it : Armenia is getting itchy.
Esin.
Let me clearify Mr. Turkish
ARMENIA is NOT getting itchy . SHE is simply LETTING the WORLD KNOW that SHE
WILL NO LONGER sit there QUIET and LET TURKS get away with their FAMOUS
tricks. Armenians DO REMEMBER of the TURKISH invasion of the Greek island of
CYPRESS WHILE the world simply WATCHED.
