Too bad nothing will happen to her or him. The FBI and the media have
done their job well.
Just want to make a comment on this. If you live in this country long
enough, you should realize the media is no friend of the govt. I am
only concerned about fact that the media like to jump to conclusion
before the facts. But I am sure they are good in digging dirt as
well afterall, they like the controversial events, which of course
make news.
