What is the difference
I want a double spin CD ROM drive by May
looking into NEC and Apple, doublespins only
what is the best
Nec Toshiba and Sony Apple nearly deliver the same speed.
As apples prices are very low compared to there RAM SIMMS
You should buy what is inexpencive. But think of Driver revisions.
It is easier to get driver kits from Apple than from every other
manufacturer

I thought NEC and Toshiba CD ROM mechanism have an average
access time of less than 200 ms. While the SONY APPLE CD ROM
drive has an access time of 300 ms for the doublespin models.
