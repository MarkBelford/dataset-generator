Hi. I am looking into buying a Floptical Drive, and was wondering what
experience people have with the drives from Iomega, PLI, MASS MicroSystems,
or Procom. These seem to be the main drives on the market. Any advice
Also, I heard about some article in MacWorld Sep '92, I think about
Flopticals. Could someone post a summary, if they have it
Thanks in advance. Reply by post or email, whichever you prefer.
