Does anyone know of software that will allow
you to convert CorelDraw .CDR files
containing bitmaps to SCODAL, as this is the
only format our bureau's filmrecorder recognises.
Corel Draw will do it version 2 onwards. If you have version 1 perhaps an
upgrade is in order.
Another alternative would be to use a different bureau that can take PostScript.
