What kind of power cord will he get with the Apple
monitor. Does it come with two types
No. I recently bought an LC II with a 14 monitor. The monitor comes with
the type of power cable that plugs into the switched outlet on the back of
most larger Macs. Since the LC II doesn't have one of these outlets, there
was an extra standard power cable included with the computer for use with
the monitor. But it was in the computer box, not the monitor box. It's
not as if the cables are particularly expensive, though. $10 $15 at the
most.
