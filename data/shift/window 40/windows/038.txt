From article , by Warren E. Fridy III :
2 Can you set up a short cut key to return to the Program Manager
I know CTL ESC , ESC will do it, but I'd rather set it up so I
can avoid the task list and get back to the P M with ALT F1 .
You might try the recorder and make a micro.
Now isn't that just amazing :
Seriously, add program manager to your startup group and define a
shortcut for it. Works.
