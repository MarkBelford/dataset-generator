For all those interested, I would like to inform all that Binyamin Netanyahu
leader of the Israeli Likud party will be interviewed on CNN tonight on
Larry King Live.
didn't this guy go crying on the zionist tv confessing
that he committed adultary, and was cheating on his wife.
a typical jew leader, huh

What else do you expect Israel is trying to portray itself

who previously had an extra marital affair e.g. Bill Clinton
It helps if your wife says it's OK.
